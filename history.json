A comprehensive review of its performance is scheduled for the end of the week.\n*   **Automation and Manual Intervention:** The system is confirmed to be fully automated from start to end. However, \"take profit\" mechanisms are occasionally managed manually. This approach is preferred over fixed take-profits due to observations that the \"maximum favorable excursion\" (potential profit) often exceeds the actual profit captured, highlighting a need for optimization in this area.\n*   **Recent Trade Confirmation (Banana S31 Pump):** Discussion confirmed that the automated system successfully initiated a trade during the recent \"banana S31 pump.\" This occurred because the funding rate closed below 2%, aligning with the system's defined trading logic.\n*   **Current Market Observations:** Brief mention was made of a \"green dot\" signal on the BTC five-minute chart, and David noted his current short position on ETH.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n*   A thorough performance review of the automated trading system will be conducted by the end of the current week.\n*   Manual management of \"take profits\" will continue as an interim measure, with a clear understanding that this component requires future optimization within the automated system.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   **David/Team:** Conduct a full performance review of the automated trading system (\"funding stuff\") by the end of the week.\n*   **Aman/David:** Evaluate and optimize the profit-taking mechanism within the automated system to more effectively capture maximum favorable excursions.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nThe primary next step involves the comprehensive end-of-week performance review of the automated trading system to assess its effectiveness and identify further strategic refinements.",

It did, actually. I saw it yesterday. Oh, okay. Good, good. Yeah, at least so it's picking up, uh, it's picking up assets when your logic hits.

        "summary": "**Minutes of Meeting**\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Participants:** David, Aman, Q\n\n---\n\n**1. Meeting Objective**\nThe primary objective of this call was to review the current status and performance of automated trading strategies, discuss potential new strategies and technical indicators, streamline backtesting methodologies, and outline collaborative action items.\n\n**2. Key Discussions**\n\n*   **Funding Rate Strategy Status:**\n    *   The fully automated funding rate strategy is currently operational on AWS, requiring minimal manual intervention.\n    *   Recent performance indicates a slight downturn over the past two to three days.\n    *   Manual profit-taking has been intermittently applied to optimize gains, as the \"maximum favorable excursion\" often exceeds the fixed profit target.\n    *   The algorithm successfully executed a trade during the Banana S31 pump, validating its logic under specific funding rate conditions (below 2%).\n    *   A past challenge involved dynamic changes in funding rate intervals by exchanges, which Aman successfully addressed to ensure accurate system adaptation.\n\n*   **Dorito Indicator Analysis:**\n    *   Observations of the \"Green Dorito\" signal on BTC and ETH charts were discussed, with David noting a current short position on ETH.\n    *   The Dorito indicator is an open-source tool, originating from a Forex guru's strategy and adapted for TradingView.\n    *   It functions solely based on price action (OHLC) without volume integration, appearing to identify swing failure patterns.\n    *   Q is actively working on replicating and backtesting this indicator within a Python framework, aiming to make its hardcoded lookback variable adjustable for extensive parameter optimization.\n\n*   **VWAP/SMA Mean Reversion Strategy (Cluster Fading):**\n    *   This strategy, inspired by D-Speed's performance, involves fading price touches of clustered VWAPs and Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).\n    *   Initial statistical analysis by Aman indicates potential, with a rudimentary backtest showing a 1% stop loss and 3% take profit, yielding positive win rate, profit factor, and expectancy over a two-year period on ETH.\n    *   Crucially, key performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown, and capital efficiency (including fees) are yet to be thoroughly calculated.\n    *   Potential confluences, including volume spikes or volume delta, were discussed to enhance entry and exit signals.\n\n*   **Momentum Breakout Strategy (Altcoin Volume Spikes):**\n    *   Q presented a screener-based strategy identifying altcoins with significant comparative volume increases (e.g., 5000% volume change).\n    *   This strategy leverages Q's custom tick-level database (53 billion rows) to generate 30-second candles with USD buy/sell volume, enabling cross-asset ranking by volume.\n    *   The core signal involves assets rapidly climbing volume rankings (e.g., from rank 200 to below 100), indicating potential for subsequent price movements, even if current price action is subdued.\n    *   Current execution is manual, relying on discretionary entries with tight stop losses and trailing stops for profit capture. Full automation is a future goal.\n    *   Backtesting this strategy effectively necessitates analyzing the entire market universe to avoid hindsight bias.\n\n*   **Backtesting Framework and Tools:**\n    *   Q detailed his robust Python-based backtesting library, which provides comprehensive trade logs, performance statistics (including Sharpe/Sortino ratios), and visualizable equity curves. The library is optimized for speed using Numba and runs on powerful local infrastructure.\n    *   TradingView's strategy tester offers visual benefits but is acknowledged to have limitations in complex condition handling.\n    *   The possibility of developing a custom TradingView-like user interface, integrated with Q's database to display additional data (e.g., footprint Delta) and enable direct exchange execution, was discussed as a long-term project.\n\n*   **Trading Philosophy and Risk Management:**\n    *   The challenges of shorting for US citizens (due to exchange limitations like Coinbase spot-only) were raised, though alternative access to perp exchanges was noted.\n    *   Counterparty risk from exchange hacks (e.g., FTX, Bybit) remains a significant concern, leading to the practice of maintaining minimum collateral on exchanges.\n    *   The importance of adaptive trailing stop losses for momentum strategies was emphasized to mitigate drawdowns and protect profits.\n    *   To avoid hindsight bias, it was suggested to primarily backtest strategies on Bitcoin or, ideally, across the entire asset universe simultaneously.\n\n**3. Decisions Made**\n\n*   **Strategy Prioritization:** The team will prioritize focusing on one strategy at a time to ensure concentrated progress.\n*   **Initial Focus for Development:** The immediate focus will be on further developing and backtesting the mean reversion strategy, incorporating the Dorito pivot levels as a potential confluence.\n*   **Collaborative Backtesting:** Q will recreate Aman's mean reversion strategy in his Python backtesting framework. Concurrently, David and Aman will attempt to implement a foundational version of a strategy (e.g., simple moving average crossover) on TradingView to familiarize themselves with its strategy tester and then attempt the mean reversion setup for comparative analysis.\n*   **Data Scope:** Backtesting efforts will initially concentrate on crypto markets due to existing data infrastructure.\n\n**4. Action Items**\n\n*   **Aman:** Share the code for the mean reversion strategy's signal generation logic.\n*   **Q:**\n    *   Continue development of the Dorito indicator recreation and backtesting in Python.\n    *   Upon receipt of Aman's code, backtest the mean reversion strategy using his Python library and provide results within 24 hours.\n    *   Share his personal GitHub repository for collaborative code development.\n    *   Explore the development of a dashboard/UI for the momentum breakout screener.\n*   **David/Aman:**\n    *   Engage with the TradingView strategy tester by implementing a simple strategy to gain proficiency with the tool.\n    *   Subsequently, attempt to implement a basic version of the mean reversion strategy on TradingView for comparison with Q's Python results.\n*   **All:** Reconvene in two to three days (before Friday) to discuss progress on assigned tasks.\n\n**5. Next Steps**\n\n*   Compare backtesting results between Q's Python framework and TradingView for the mean reversion strategy.\n*   Further refine the mean reversion strategy with additional confluences.\n*   Systematize the momentum breakout strategy with automated entry, exit, and trailing stop logic.\n*   Explore the feasibility and benefits of building the custom TradingView-like UI for enhanced visualization and direct exchange execution.",

What do you able to see the um, what is it? The banana S31 pump yesterday. Like because the funding went negative and so I tagged you on the main chat, but not sure if you guys or the algo acted on it and took the trade. Uh it was after hours for me, which is why I didn't reply. Um Oh. No, I got it. We checked the logs, see if it traded. I mean, if if the funding closed below 2%, then we would have traded. Yeah, it did actually. I saw it yesterday. Oh, okay, good, good. Yeah, at least so it's picking up uh it's picking up assets when your logic hits. Uh what whatever that is, like the rules that you have specified. Yeah. That's right. By the way, uh David, if I may call you that. Uh Hey, yeah. Oh, sorry. Okay. Uh, there's a green Dorito on uh BTC five minute. Okay, nice. I'm actually short. Um, I'm I'm short ETH right now. Um, so that's interesting. Yeah, so the Dorito is where you take profits, right? Like if you are short. Yeah. There is a green Dorito on ETH as well. Sorry. Oh, really? Need to hunt that layout. No, maybe. Oh, I did not share the layout. Sorry. I'll send it right away. No, it's okay. I've uh I've got something rigged up here. Yeah, I see what you mean. That's probably quite a strong signal. Yeah. uh with two together like that. Or at least take some profits if that makes sense. take some off here then and uh and I can stop back in lower down. Yeah. By the way, uh I'm trying to see if I can recreate this the Doritos indicator, uhm and back test it. He's not shared. He's not shared the source code, but uh yeah, there It is open source, actually. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. I didn't even know what it's based on. I mean, I eyeballed it. Um, and I couldn't see what it was. It looks like some sort of swing failure on on the price action. Yes. I don't I don't know if it incorporates volume or not. Uh, no, it doesn't. It's just price action OHLC, no volume. Interesting. Okay. Interesting. That was my suspicion. And So, so you know Insilico, right? The guy in Insilico, not the Insilico terminal. Nod. Uh so that guy, that guy was in crypto a long time ago and then he started a Telegram channel, uh where he posted random content, which was like pure alpha. And And then he also started coding indicators on TradingView. So this is one of his indicators on TradingView. Oh, I see. Interesting. But but it is not his original indicator. He's told this indicator from some Forex guru, uh who was trading foreign exchange, uh like currencies. Um and just converted it to a TradingView script. Oh, okay. All this all this was like seven, eight years ago, nine years ago. How'd you know about this, Q? Eh, somebody was speaking about some on the somebody pointed it out in the group chat, in the voice chat, uh one time. Oh. And then I looked it up and behold. So, the Vespa indicator has a lot of other things, the levels, but the Doritos itself is a completely separate indicator with the same input, same language, same everything. That's pretty interesting. I don't I don't want to burst his bubble, but uh like I'm sure he's made some changes to the indicator, but I don't I'm trying to convert it to my I don't want to be the bad guy and say, hey, you stole this or whatever. Like he's still sharing stuff with us, right? So I want to respect that. Yeah. And and there's not many original things, right? When it comes to tracking indicators. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, Q, it's really interesting because the first time he spoke about it, for the first time I heard about him. He said it it was related to volume. Um and I I just I had my doubts about that because I just couldn't see any correlation or any connection to volume whenever I looked at it on a chart. Yeah. Um but but I could see some price patterns. So it's interesting it's interesting that uh you don't see the volume connection either. Right? I I'll just share, uh, the exact, like you see this page, please keep it to yourself, David. I don't want any issues within the within the group, if that makes sense. 100%. 100%. No, I I won't I won't share any of this. So if you look at just the screenshot, I see. Yeah. Uh that's very, very similar to what And so, this is the TradingView indicator that is open source. Like you can look at it's it's 60 lines of code. Okay. I'm going to wait. Let me I'm going to put this on my TradingView now. Yeah. You can you can hide the Vespa indicator and just put the same input like 4060 or 4010 or 60100 or whatever and it will draw the same lines and the same Doritos. Oh, really? Interesting. Okay, that's very interesting. Yeah, okay. So, 40 100. Yeah, even the um the input has the same names as well. Yes. Okay, sure. Yeah, I won't I won't mention anything, Q, don't worry. Okay. Yeah, thanks for sharing that. No, again, I'm not I'm not saying it is bad or whatever, but I'm just trying to convert this into Python to see if uh we can systematically find an edge there, like with a tight stop loss. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Because the input he's given us, which is 4060 or 60100, uh they are different from the default inputs, which is like 4010 on the indicator. Yes. Um and and I want to see over time if those indicators, like we're not trying to overfit, but we want to actually fit to and this source code was is from 2019, like if you see the date. So that's like six years old. Yeah. And the way actually I found it also I confirmed it was, uh, he he liked if you go on his profile, he liked this indicator itself and that looks very similar to Vespa. And so I was like, okay, if he's liked it, he's not commented on on the TradingView screen or anything. He's just liked it and so. Um and if you search for the name, there is actually a few like other platforms that use the same indicator for trading. Hmm. That's some very good s- thing. I mean, I'm not spoofing. I just wanted to see what the juice is and like trying to replicate it. Yeah, no, no, it's cool. I mean, I I wondered about it myself. Um I just had no idea how to actually go about figuring that out. Yeah. Um but you know, that's very interesting because um Naman and I did some stats a few weeks ago and we were looking at the the moving averages and the VWAPs. Yeah. Um and uh well, so I I I I'll share another secret with you then. Uh Q, uh I I shared a screenshot of of the equity curve, um uh that D-Speed shared and, um, and I said to I said to Naman, like, you know, this um this is an automated strategy. It's based on VWAPs and SMAs. Uh and and we started trying to figure out ways to um to replicate that or or work out our own strategy. Mm-hmm. Um we didn't we didn't really we didn't do anything on it yet because, um, we we focused our efforts getting the funding rate strategy running. Yes. Um, but we did do some stats on it. Um, or Naman did some stats that were quite cool. Um. So Sorry if you if you don't mind me asking. So you just shared the equity curve that he posted with Naman? Well, just the screenshot. Just just basically It's just to show. I mean, he didn't say anything about what the strategy was. Yes. He just said it was related to Vespa. So I was saying to Naman, you know, can we do something based on moving averages and VWAPs? And I think that was not Vespa or moving averages. That was basically this indicator because that gives you the entry and the exit signals. Okay. Interesting. So we can again, we can It's not very difficult to do a back testing on TradingView. And I can once I finish coding this in Python and I have my data and I run it against my database to see if we are getting similar results on TradingView versus my results and so that way we can compare, uh, if where there are discrepancies is there a bug in the code in the indicator or is there a bug in the signal or what's wrong before we bring before we even consider like, hey, if it is profitable and the equity curve is good, before we bring it live if that makes sense. So, uh, so you're saying we should back test some strategies, Q, is that is that the idea? Yeah, so back test on the same strategy, for example, on TradingView versus in Python. Say. Oh, so they should match. Ideally, they should match because the underlying data for price action is the same, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh so the equity curve, the drawdown, everything should be very similar. Yeah, yeah, they should be this they should be identical, right? Yeah. In theory. Okay. And then and then on top of that, what TradingView doesn't have, what I have is the buy sell delta. So we can incorporate those things into the strategy. Like trap traders, uh things like that. Because this strategy is just purely based on price action. But then we can add more confluences to improve the entries and the exits. Yeah, I think some confluences would most likely be needed. I think just trading the the Doritos on by themselves, well, I haven't tested it, but I would imagine it's not effective by itself. And so you tested that, Q? Just a a Dorito only strategy. Um, no, I'm still just coding the indicator. I found this over the weekend when I was scrolling. I I didn't I I haven't had a lot of time with the indicator myself. So I have to first code it in Python. Try to replicate the same Doritos first in Python before I even back test it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Um, the other thing is, um, that I want to test is, uh, There are two variables in, um, in the input of the indicator. But there is one other variable that is hardcoded in the function itself. And if Naman wants to see, I can share the source code, but, uh, are you, uh, David, are you in front of the TradingView screen? I can share. Yes, I am. So if you click on the source code, don't open the source code. It'll just open in a small window in on the screen. Uh for the indicator, yeah. Yes. Okay. So line nine and 10 is, uh, the inputs, but then, uh, if you see line 20 and 21, it is comparing close versus like the close of four, meaning the fourth candle before the current candle. Yep, I see that. So four is hardcoded. We can add that as a variable, like how far do you want the lookback to be? Ah, okay. So that way we can make my my uh back testing library that I use, uh, can identify, can loop through all these inputs. So I can in the first input, instead of just doing 40, I can do 40, 50, 60, 70 up to 100. The second input I can do 10, 20, 30 up to 100. The third input I can do three, four, five, six, or whatever, I can pass in a list and then it will loop through all of those, uh, permutations and combinations and tell me for this asset, which is the best it is over fitting, but for this asset, which is the best, uh, inputs that you can use. And we can use those inputs on because right now we need to use TradingView for visualization. I don't have, I don't have, uh, like UI built in into my coding, my trading system. So, until then, we can use those inputs to visualize what is going on on the indicator itself. Okay. Am I am I clear? Am I vague? Sorry. So, what I think so, I'm I'm I'm not an expert when it comes to the technical stuff of you. So, what I'm what I'm what I'm hearing is you're suggesting that we adjust the indicator so that we can adjust this extra variable and then just experiment with it visually on TradingView. Uh, no, I will experiment in the back end with my back testing framework, which will give me, which will tell me, hey, these are the good inputs that you should use, uh, will perform the best based on the back test. And then we we put those numbers in to see what is actually happening on TradingView. Okay. Yeah, I see. I see. And then we could do like a a strategy on TradingView with those parameters. Yes. Okay, got it. That makes sense. Um And then we can add more confluences like levels, predefined levels like yearly VWAP, 200-day moving average or or even the high time frame and low time frame indicators. like or high time frame like you were saying, D-wall, I think that's what you said. Uh You said something like we need to get into a low time frame, uh our wall to see to to perfect our entries and exits. Well, that that was just one one suggestion. Yeah, so. Maybe, um, Naman, could you do me a favor? Could you please, um, get the stats, uh that we have for the, um, the the SMA and and the VWAP uh fading strategy and put them on the chat here. Oh, shipping, sir. Just keep Uh shipping. I will just uh give me a minute, please. Yeah, no, of course. Thank you. So, I mean, So I guess there's different strategies, right, Q? So, uh when it comes to the big when it comes to the the VWAPs and the SMAs, uh and trading trading um and trading when they're when they're overlapping one one another. I think that's fundamentally a a fading strategy, right? Um And we've got some basic stats on that. It's a just a starting point for now. Um but uh you'll have a look at them in a moment and I think there's something there. And then if we wanted to add confluences to that, I suppose they'd have to be confluences that make sense, right? So, I I was just brainstorming here, um of some indicators that could add add conviction. Um We haven't tested it, but it stands to reason that, um, if if if, um, a cluster of, um, of SMAs and VWAPs, um, are going to be strong support or strong resistance and they're going to hold, there should be some kind of spike in volume at least at least on the low time frame. or or some noticeable increase. I think something like that might be worth testing. Okay. Especially because it's probably quite easy to test. Um and you you could go infinitely more complex, like, um, we could start, you know, looking at like some CBD, um, some increases in in volume delta. Um, my only concern with stuff like that is that if it starts getting too complex, um, then you're you know, you you start over fitting. Um and and once it gets too complex, it probably just doesn't work. So, the other strategy I was thinking after. So, one thing I say we do is we prioritize which strategy do we want to go for first, which is either we do, uh, the Vespa Doritos or, uh, those are the two that I was most recently working on, which is why I'm saying that or the momentum breakout strategy, which is, uh, like alts flying 30, 40% and we capture the upside on those. So which one should we prioritize? Uh, I don't want to go, uh, in all directions and like not make any progress. So I would rather stick with one, we we find the results and see if there's something there for us and we make progress that way. Yeah, I completely agree. I completely agree with that. Um Oh, by the way, sorry, one other thing. I don't have access, so Naman, if you can grant that email address that I shared earlier. Yeah, just a second. So, Q, um, a a note on these statistics. Um, Uh, same same comment that you made actually before. Like because this, um, this this work sort of belongs to D-Speed. So, um, I did actually share this with him. Um, when we did it. Um, and I said I I and I only shared it with him. Uh, and I just just said, look, you know, this is this is your thing. So I'm not putting it on the group, right? Uh same thing, same thing that you said. Um. Um, and and we left it at that. Um, I thought I thought he might be interested in sort of working on something automated, but, um, I don't know, I've tried to catch up with him a couple of times. Um, I don't think it's a priority for him right now. Yeah. I think at least what I am assuming that he's just doing this because he's passionate, not because he needs the money for, uh, for his day-to-day life. Like he's had, uh, he has enough resources that he could care less about optimizing a strategy which, like he doesn't need this for a living. Like he doesn't want to spend more efforts than it is necessary. It seems that way to me. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree. But I think, um, well, it's something we can discuss later, Q. Yeah. Uh, what what I would mean I I would probably well, we can discuss it. I mean, I would probably want to sort of let him know what progress we're making, what we're doing, um, out of just uh courtesy, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, so this is one setup. Right? Uh, Yes, one setup. So, if you So, the the the first page is just kind of like the explanation. And then the statistics tab on the left, if you can see that. Yeah. So that's got the statistics on it. Um, so what we were basically looking at here was, um, a very, very basic mean reversion strategy, so fading the 200 MA, for example. Uh I think I think we've got a few different levels mentioned in this document. Uh, quarterly VWAP. And then I do believe there's going to be, um, an overlapping levels strategy as well. that had the best and that had the yeah, here we go. So if you towards the bottom uh clustered indicators. Um Can I, uh, Share my screen if that is easier? I think you are on the wrong page. Uh it needs to be on the statistics page. Yeah, I'm on the statistics page. I'm on I'm looking at Eth and So. So if you scroll all the way to the bottom, Yeah. So, the the final uh black black box with the table of figures on it. Uh top scenarios. Yes, I see it. Combined long short. So, this is kind of this is the best the the best, uh, most basic back test that we did. Mm-hmm. And and this is quite rudimentary, but it's a a cluster of three um of three overlapping uh levels and it can be any levels, right? So, uh any any combination of of three SMAs and VWAPs. Okay. And then you're you're fading fading a touch of that cluster. Yeah. Uh and then you see um so the back test, you've got the 1% stop loss, 3% take profit. Uh win rate, profit factor and expectancy. Yeah. So there's definitely something there. There's definitely something there. Um, Naman, do you remember, um, how far back this back test goes? Um, I don't think it was I think two years or three years, maybe? Yes, it was two years. Okay. So, so Q, it's that that's not that's not a very large number of trades for two years, right? But but also it is only it's it's it's also only one market. Yes, but so sorry, quick question. Do you know, say, uh, like what are the numbers, what is the the sharp or the sortino of this strategy or what is what is the starting capital and the max drawdown and what is the ending ending capital with and without fees? So that way we know, yes, this stats, these stats are good, but without those numbers, it is hard for us to visualize what the equity curve for that strategy is going to be because since this is all 100% automated. Indeed. I'm not sure if we have those. Uh Naman, yeah, can you answer please? Yes, I think we were in the early stage of testing this, so we were just applying some Monte Carlo principles, uh trying out random things and uh figuring out what could work best. We haven't went towards that and switched towards another project instead. I see. Okay. So, uh David, it feels like yes, there's something there, but but we need hello. And and I'll share one of my strategies, one of my very basic strategies and how I do, uh, my back testing and I will share the output of that back testing framework. Um, and I can actually share it in the chat right now one sec. So that gives us more comprehensive, uh, information. So, so what happens is,\nWhen you back test. So first step is coding an indicator. Once you code an indicator, you generate signals based on that indicator. Or regardless how you code an indicator, you generate signals based on whatever your rules are and whatever your criterias are. And and when you pass that information to the back testing framework, it tells you when it takes the trade. uh when it gets stopped out, or when it gets uh exited into take profit. And then at the end of it, uh when the entire time series passes through, it gives you the stats of how profitable the strategy is. So you can do that with fees, without fees. And then it gives you, if you want, you can plot the price and the equity curve, uh like how DSpeed shared, uh in Python, and so you can actually visualize, hey, this is the time it took a trade. It actually gives you the time stamp of when the criteria met and you actually entered the trade. So you it is as if you are looking at a strategy performing live, but on historical data. Yeah. Yeah. And you do this on TradingView? No, no, no. This is all in Python, in my, in my application. Oh, nice. Okay. You have created a library also? Uh, yes. So I do have uh a few different libraries that I use uh to get this information. So this is what I worked on last two, three years. Uh, when I was doing all the data collection and all the stuff that I did for my uh my database. So like I already have some pre-calculated indicators in the database. So like moving average. Yes, it is not taking time. But if you were to always calculate for 400 assets on like say four or five different time frames, that takes time. Um, and then it is also optimized to run faster. So uh Yeah, we can we can go in detail about that, but like I'll just share uh the exact uh output of what the indicator or what the back testing library gives me. Okay. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, this sounds good. But without without the um, the sharp ratio, the starting capital, the ending capital, or sorry, where you're ending, you don't know actually if the strategy is profitable or not. Okay. So in that case, um, if if you agree that this is worth pursuing, then it sounds to me like we have a pathway uh to move forward. So do you want to do So then this is the third strategy on top of the Doritos, the the momentum breakout on alls. And this is like adding Do you want to add this as a confluence to the first two or do you want to um do you want to add this as a completely separate strategy? To me, it seems like a separate strategy. Um, Okay. In terms of the alt breakout, um, I don't actually know how you're trading that, Q. I mean, is that is that deployed right now? Is it something you're doing? No, I it's not automated. I'm getting alerts. Um, and based on those alerts, I act on it. Okay. Is it, and is it working for you? Yes. Okay. Okay, well that's good. Um, I think it would be different. Um, to be honest, I think it's a separate strategy. Okay. Um, so we could treat them. I mean, we could focus on the personal on the alt breakout if if that's already working. Um, Or we could do, yeah, I'm I'm I'm quite open Q, to be honest. Um, quite open in terms of the order. All right. Um, so I am personally working on uh the Doritos. I've shared the code with you if you want to work on it. That's fine. Or we can uh converge, um like you guys can go ahead with a different strategy. You already have access to my database. So um, if you want to code it in TradingView or Python, that's up to you. Uh, I'm going to definitely or what we can do is, you convert this uh indicator into a TradingView strategy, and I do that on my side on Python, and then maybe in a day or two we come back and compare our results. So we, okay, so we turn Doritos into a uh Python script and then backtest it. Is that what you mean? That is what I am doing. And you guys do the same thing on TradingView because TradingView backtesting there's an option on TradingView backtesting. That DSpeed shared. Yeah, I think that's doable. Um, yeah. I'm just trying to think, because I know that TradingView backtesting has some limitations. Yes. It has a lot of like you can't in terms of conditions and stuff. It's very limited. But I think if, because what we'd want to do is we we'd want to to give it all of these levels and say, look, if any three of them are within say half a percent of one another, then then you fade that level if the price touches it. That's the basic strategy, right? So I don't know, no. So, um, I actually, um, and no one I don't know no one, have you used the strategy tester on TradingView? Uh, yes, I've used it but uh I'm not really the most fond of it as it gives less less flexibility than Python. So, I would prefer that. Yes. Yes. So, or what we can do is, um, I don't mind working in Python, both of us working together. Just that, I don't have a very good way to visualize it. When I give when my back testing gives an output, it is like line by line of what the equity curve looks like and line by line of what trades it takes. So, there's no good way for me to visualize what is going on, which is why I was sticking with TradingView. But that's okay, we don't have to stick with TradingView. Um, may no like if you can explain like uh what kind of output you receive? Yes, I, I was trying to find one, um, and just paste it in the chat. Give me one minute, I can do that. Or I can do this in like five, 10 minutes after the call. I have to find that code, uh and I'll run it against my, uh so I was testing a rolling Vpop strategy, um, after the after working with Horse, uh to see if there's any anything we can extract from there. Uh, no worries. Actually uh it would be uh okay if you just verbally share it like, is it like a CSV of all the trade logs or is it like uh some sort of So it's not a CSV. It just prints on the standard output. Oh, got it. Yeah, so I have a Python program I run which gets the data, uh generates the signals, and then against that data, it backtests everything and then gives you an output of all the trades. And then, uh you can also uh do matplotlib or plotly integration and plot that time series to be able to see what is going on. Yeah, I understand. That's what I was thinking about, like it's pretty easy. You can just load it in uh PD data frame. Yes. So, it is in the Pandas data frame. That's the input for the backtester. Uh the time series, one time series is the price, the other time series is a signal. Um, and then it outputs, uh, what trades it took, and what what was the profit factor, what was the sortino, what was the sharp ratio, all of that. Yeah, I get it. So, in Python where we use like the print function for the standard output, we can just replace it with like uh uh storing it, appending it to our Pandas data frame and then visualize it quickly. Yep, yep, yep. Okay. So, uh, David, if you don't mind, do you do you want us? Do you think me and Naman can work together on this uh Doritos and then we add more confluence like other other SMAs and EMAs? I think so, yeah. Are you are you in sort of in general agreement um about the style of the strategy? that that it's it's a fading strategy? I would say it's a mean reversion strategy now. Yeah, mean reversion. Yeah. So, so when the price touches those clusters of levels, then we would be, yeah, we'd be fading it and looking for mean reversion. Yeah. Yes, yes. Okay, perfect. Yeah, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Um. Yeah. And then to be honest, I think if we can add the the Dorito pivots as an additional level to work with. I think that's that's probably going to be very good. Okay. So, uh, Naman, do you have uh a notebook or a Python script where you're you ran these stats on? Like, uh, because this is Monte Carlo is not as useful, it's just random. So, um, even though you're running it on a higher time frame or multiple different times, um, I don't know if it is accurate enough to predict how the markets will react. Like, or will the markets react the same way? Um, So I would instead I would instead fit it on the existing Pandas series, uh, of data to see what what uh EMAs and SMAs work better against it. Um, just just to clarify quickly, uh it's not using uh randomly created market data. Instead, uh it's using the actual uh historical data. Uh, but uh the parameters which we are testing, like uh stop loss and take profit and other stuff like that, uh those are usually the random instead. I see. Yes. And also the clusters we are trying to test out, like how you told, like we can test multiple clusters from two to three, to five and something like that. Got it. Got it. Um, yeah. So, if you don't mind, so the other thing Naman, do you have like a GitHub repository where you're keeping all this code? Um, I don't mind sharing my repository where I have, um, all of my work with the indicators and all that stuff. Um, And so that way if you want to collaborate that way or we can start a completely new repository and that's fine too. Um, I don't have a repo, but uh because I'm working mostly locally. So, Okay. Uh, I can create one. Um, No, that's fine. Uh, the other thing is, uh, David, how are you interested or how much does it interest you to do the TradingView integration on on our application. Like not on TradingView TradingView, on like the source code that I have from a few years ago in Angular React and we integrate that into into our database. I need to understand um a little bit better um, how are we going to use that? And what are the benefits of that? Hmm. So, TradingView right now does not give us the Delta meaning the footprint Delta. Yes. So, it cannot give us, um, But since I have all that data in my local database, we can plot that on the existing, we can change the code of the existing TradingView library and add that as a functionality to be able to visualize the Delta like how have you used MMT uh before? Yes. Yeah. Okay. So, so we could get would it look like a TradingView UI, but with add added data that we can put into it? Yes. Oh, I see. Okay, that's very cool. Um. But then, but then on top of it, if we spend more time, we can add execution directly to the exchange from it. So, like if you want, so you've used In Silico Terminal also, right? Yes, many times. Yes. So, this can be your personal In Silico Terminal where the UI directly connects to the exchange and you can trade, take trades from the TradingView that you're looking at. So, that TradingView won't be the TradingView website. It will look exactly like TradingView, but you're taking trades off of your, this this will be integrated as your own application like how MMT is. I see. Um, I'm open to it. Um, Okay. And, I mean, um, as and when it's necessary. Yeah. I mean, at the moment, I guess it would just be for an extra to add some extra indicators. Um, yeah, I'm open to it. Um, I don't have much experience with that kind of thing. So, I think I'd probably not make it the priority right now unless it's going to add anything of what we're doing. Yeah. Um, I think if if I'm understanding correctly, I think the priorities now should be, um, for us to, well, as you suggested, Q, we need to run some more data on this on this strategy, incorporate the Dorito pivot levels. Um, and tweak the parameters in the way that you described. Um, and then and then get some equity curves. Um. Yeah. If we're able to backtest a lot of different scenarios um quite efficiently, it might be worth going outside of crypto as well and looking at single name stocks. Yes. Yes. Um, and some commodities as as well, maybe. But I do not, unfortunately, have uh the data for it. So, we have to spend time collecting and storing that data in the database. I see. Before before we backtest it. Um, because backtesting is not difficult. Collecting the data, cleaning that up, making sure it's usable is the difficult part. Okay. I see. Uh, Q, if you if you agree, should we just focus on crypto for now? Uh, make it work here and then all the stuff we can draw out later. Yes. I like that because because so the other thing is, in my backtesting we can, so and I'm just trying to be a devil's advocate. Please don't think that I'm trying to cut your strategy apart or say it's not profitable. That's my job as a teammate to critique your work and I would expect you would do the same for me. Um, like if there's something I bring up to the the same thing what DSpeed did to your funding strategy on the call. Um, which is we don't know what percentage of So, I'm looking at the the document Naman shared. Uh, it says 186 trades. We don't know what percentage of those 86 are longs versus shorts. Yes. So, and the reason I bring that up is because say for someone like me, I don't know, um, I don't have the ability to short because I'm I'm on Coinbase and I'm only using spot. So, I want the strategy to be long only because that is the only option I get. Uh that is the only option I get uh on Coinbase. Okay. That's interesting. I mean, We'll we'll have to see if that's a limitation or or not. And I know on one of the data sets, um, I don't know if we did it for the for the clusters, um, but when we tested, when we tested touches of a single level, uh we tested the 200 day moving and the yearly VWAP. And there was a significant difference in performance. Uh longs versus shorts. And um, I don't remember which one was the higher performer. I it may it may even have been shorts, actually. Got it. Um, Um, but Q, I just want to make a comment on that. Um, there there's many ways as a US citizen, um, for you to get access to these other purps exchanges. And and we can go into it at some point. Um, Sure. I mean, if if if you have it if you've got a profitable strategy that requires you to short, um, I I wouldn't see that as a um as a roadblock. Okay. And you're probably you're probably gathered from what a lot of the other guys have mentioned, you know, there's ways there's ways and means. Yes. And and we're we're on Binance and we're on everything. Yeah. Yeah, I I have um and so the same thing that happened with Hype today. Like, there's there's cases. You know, even Bybit got hacked for a couple billion dollars, right? Uh, in East. Yes. And and so there is always going to be that counterparty risk that will always loom in the back of your mind. Like, this is not been the first hack. We've had Bitfinex, we've had FTX, we've had Bybit, now there's rumors about Hype and what is going on on Hype. So, so the point being that yes, even though we have those avenues, we can't put size on there. Like, I don't even put size on Coinbase, let alone uh an offshore exchange like Binance or Bybit. Yes, they are they are they are reputable. But but uh we can instead use margin like how DSpeed is using to increase the position size instead of putting more capital there. And paying the paying the funding price, funding fees. Because that makes sense. If your strategy is profitable, you don't need to worry about your position size. Okay, that that that's the never-ending headache of this industry. Yes. Yeah. I mean, ever everything everything is on leverage. Absolute minimum, minimum collateral, uh for whatever you're doing is is is the norm. For for good reason. For good reason as you say. Yeah. I mean, we we I mean just for context. I mean, anything we do, we keep the bare minimum uh collateral uh required for for whatever is needed. Yeah. And and and also, you know, we can trade, you can trade on like 50x leverage on most exchanges. So, it's not you know, it's you can make it work. You can make it work. Yeah. It's just an unfortunately, that's the never-ending hazard in this business. Not not on Coinbase, I cannot because I have to put for a $50,000 position, I have to put $50,000. It sucks. That sucks. On spot. On spot. But that's that's yeah. That's not capital efficient. Oh, it's not, indeed. Yeah, no, I mean, um, yeah. Uh, I I'd say yeah, put a pin in it, Q. It would be my my take on that. Um, and and there's there's ways and means. If if you've got a profitable strategy, it doesn't need to be a roadblock. Yes. So, let me let me work on the Doritos. And if you want, if you, Naman, if you have found out like there are some EMAs that work better. So, how do you generate signals on those EMAs? Um, so if you can share some code, um, say on Sol or ETH, the two assets that you have done analysis on, I can I can run some, if you are generating signals on the Pandas series, I can run some backtesting numbers and see if your numbers match with mine. With the same stop loss, take profit, uh, etc, etc. Um, I'm sorry, may you please repeat, like uh So, um, the document that you shared, the cluster of indicators V7 with EMAs. Um, cluster three, I don't know what that means. But like I can input the stop loss of 1% and take profit of 1% um, and see what time frame is this on. And then I can I can come up with the same statistics. I can backtest what you have already done with my backtesting library and I can bring you the results to see if that strategy is profitable. Uh, sure thing. Actually, uh, it's not really, uh, more like a, um, I would say it's more like a plug-and-play thing where we just plug the dataset of any symbol and it will just do this. And regarding the three things, uh, regarding, um, three clusters, like it would be looking for any specific three indicators. So, So, do you mind do you have time? Do you mind sharing your screen and going over like what do you mean by plug and play and what do you where do you input your Pandas series and how does it give you this output? Oh, so we uh have stored like a lot of CSV data, and how I do it personally is like I just change the file name to the specific CSV and all the code is modular so it auto detect everything uh pre-defined. And then we just have to change the symbol name and it will just automatically do the rest of job on that specific symbol. So, it was originally made for the Bitcoin but uh I just change the symbol name and we do it on the other things. Yes, I get it. But like how how is it generating the signals? Like where to long, where to short? Um, if you notice on the main page like uh on the document, there's like given the strategy manual. Uh, we are just uh have encoded it. And then uh whenever the uh signal is generated, we just go to the data frame and check for if uh the strategy is like uh in a way like um what's the trade is there and then we uh simulate the trade on the data set and then we capture the result into another data frame, which is uh what I usually call it as the trade log and then uh utilize that final trade log and other relevant data to create these all these plots. Uh, I I understand. What I'm asking is, do you mind walking through that process on how you do that, or do you mind sharing the code where I can try to replicate the same process here on my end. Uh, sure think. Just give me a minute, please. Yeah. I actually need to look for the code because uh it might be somewhere in my system. Yeah, so and which is why uh a GitHub uh repository makes sense because that way like if there's some code you're working on, I can review uh or you can review my code and we can collaborate that way. Um, if you have a repository and if you want to push, um, just the code, not your CSVs because GitHub will not let you push all these CSV data um on GitHub. You can keep that local versus just the code can stay uh on and that way I can add integration to that like if it doesn't need to read from CSVs, it can read from my database directly. I get it. Yeah. So, so Q, what what do we need to do? Um, if we if we disband um, and reconvene in uh a couple of days. Um, what do we want to do? So, I I personally feel that I can continue working on, I don't I'm trying to understand the strategy, the mean reversion strategy manual that uh Naman shared and how it is generating the entry and the exits. Uh, but, once I figure that out, meanwhile and if he's able to share the code with me on how he's generating this information, uh, that way I can debug line by line of how the entries are generated. Um, and try to implement the same strategy on my backtester to see if it is giving the exact results. And I can I can bring those Once Naman shares the code, um, I can bring the results out from my backtester to you and like 24-hour period. Uh, until until then, until then I can keep working on until then I can keep working on the Dorito logic that I was already working on. Uh it is still a work in progress. I'm not done all the way yet. Okay. And then uh what can we do in the meantime as well? Uh meantime I would say,\nif you feel comfortable at least uh, have your code pushed up into a GitHub repository. So like all of your previous work, if you don't mind, uh, sharing that with me, uh, then I can share all of my work that I have done and we can see uh, that's, that's, that's not even a big task, like it should take half an hour maximum. But, uh, but like if, um, what, if you want, I know TradingView does not, is not the best, um, has its own limitations with strategy testing, but it would be beneficial if you could figure a way out on that, so that way once I have a strategy tester on my end, we can compare the results between the two. That would be my, that would be my take. Um, not sure what your thoughts are on this. Yeah, I think it works. Um, And then I think that part's going to be quite easy. And then I think the main part is going to be how are we going to um, how are we going to develop a process to, to backtest and tweak the parameters? Oh, that I, I have that already. So once I have the strategy, um, I have to give it a list of inputs and it will give me the list of outputs on which parameters give the best results. Oh, so is it able to test all the various different combinations? Yes. Of variables? Yes, yes. Okay. I remember. I think this is something we've you've done this before as well. I forget what it's called. Um, the computationally expensive one. I remember. Yeah. Okay. Oh. Yes. I have optimized it. It gives me an output in in minutes. Not even hours. And, uh, and the code runs even if you run one combination or if you run 20, uh, different combinations. The code doesn't take a long. It, it doesn't take linearly, uh, long to run 20 combinations. So like it's very fast. It's, it runs on machine level code. Okay. Have you compiled it? Yeah. Yes. So there is a, there's a package called Numba. Do you know Numba? Yes. Yeah, I'm using the same package. Yeah, so you, you convert that into Numba and the Numba loops, uh, are extremely fast on, uh, um, when it converts to machine level code. Um, and then I have, if I'm not able to run it on my laptop, I run it on my desktop. If I'm not able to run it on my desktop, I run it on the main server. It has 256 cores and 1 TB of RAM. So, uh, so yeah, like computer is not even a question. It runs. It's sitting in my, uh, David, it's it, the database is sitting in my, um, one of the bedrooms here at the house. And I have like two ISPs. Oh. Yes. I have two ISPs. So I don't pay for cloud at all because that is, if I were to store all this in the cloud, it is crazy expensive. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, yeah. I know. Okay. Um, okay, good. That's, that all sounds, um, that all sounds, uh, yeah, very reasonable. Cube, um. Okay. That works for me. Okay. So, naman, to summarize, uh, If you don't mind sharing the code on the, um, on the group chat here in Discord, um, I can take that code backtest it myself in Python. And meanwhile, you can use the same code to see, generate signals on TradingView and then we can compare the results on TradingView and I can compare, uh, I can come up with my results in a day or two. Yeah. Sure thing. I will uh, I will dig into my laptop and just find out because it's been a while since I we worked on this project. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Do you think it's worthwhile if if we try to do the backtest on TradingView? I mean, at least we will know we are investing time in understanding, hey, if it is worthwhile or not. So at least doing it once is worthwhile. Then we know if it is worth it or not. Okay. Okay, so we'll do that on our end then. You can just do a simple strategy. We don't have to do like a complicated one on TradingView. Like a simple, a simple moving average crossover and see how, how do you code that strategy in Pine Script on TradingView and you can look at the results. Yes. Is it going to be profitable? No. Is it a waste of time? Yes. But at least you know how to use the tool and, um, that way when you want to backtest a more complicated strategy, you're not figuring it out. Like you already know how to do backtesting on TradingView. Okay. I think the goal should be if we can, to implement a version of of this strategy on there as well, right? Yeah. So that would be, that would be our second attempt at it. Like the first attempt is to actually learn the tool itself. Okay. Okay. Uh, cool. Um, yeah, that makes sense. Hey, you mentioned earlier about, um, the the out breakout strategy. Like, so how how does that work? Um, I think I, um, shared it with you. Um, So just looking at, here I've, uh, the screenshot, um, You showed me a lot about the volume rankings, uh, and comparing them to previous day and things like that. But I, it wasn't clear to me like what what the signal is in that. Uh, So can you look, are you able to see the screenshot from the screener? Yeah, I see it. Yeah. So if you see, the rank is 91 Siren USDT. Yeah. The volume yesterday was, uh, $800,000. But the volume today is $43 million. Yes. The column, column four and column seven. I see. So the So the volume percentage change between those two days is about 5,000%. So it's not volatility percentage change, it's volume percentage change. Yeah. So just like how you compare how much asset is up or down for the day, uh, I do that for volume, meaning what was the, and this doesn't look at the total volume for the day. So this runs on, and Naman, this will be useful because, uh, there is alpha in here, which is, uh, So, David, you know my database does not only just have candles, it also has ticks. So, I have, I have about 53 billion rows in the database. Okay. Yeah. And from, from those ticks, I generate a 30-second candle. So, by default, the exchange gives you one minute candle. And they also don't give you the buy and the sell information on that. They only give you the base volume, which is in the asset. So, it does not tell you what is the actual USD volume. So, you cannot compare across assets, what is the base volume. Oh, sorry, what is the USD volume. Right. Yeah. But this with the ticks and with me generating a 30-second candle, I, I can then see what was the buy volume, what was the sell volume, and what was the USD total volume. So, the first column is USD buy volume, USD sell volume, USD volume yesterday. But it is and then USD volume, buy volume today, sell volume today, USD total volume today. But this is, today is not for the full day because today is up until from 00 to right now. So, I cannot compare the total from all of day yesterday to today. I have to compare, um, first four hours of yesterday to the first four hours of today. So, this script runs every 30 seconds. Okay. Yeah. And then, so this volume that you see on Siren $810,000, that was not for the entire day. That was until this time yesterday. From the start of yesterday to until this time yesterday. So, you're comparing, um, the first four hours from yesterday to the first four hours from today, or first six hours from yesterday to the first six hours from today. Okay. Yeah. And then it is calculating the percentage change between that volume. So, if you see, the volume spiked up. And this is sorted by volume percentage change in the descending order. So, today the rank is 91, meaning it is still not in the top 50. It is, it has climbed up to top 100 in volume, uh, today. Because there are 400 assets, 460 on Binance Futures. Uh, and then, today Siren is in the top 100 by trading volume. Uh, and if you see, because of the volume percentage change, the price has already gone up 15% on it. So, is there like a lead lag as volume ticks up, like outside of its norms and then then the price will follow? Yes. That's interesting. Because I, I, when you mentioned it before, my sort of my feeling was that there might be a lag, um, yeah, it might actually lag the other way, right? Um, but that's interesting. So that works as a leading indicator. So, if you see, uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sixth line from the top. Which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, DUSD. Yeah. Uh, the volume percentage change is 1419. Yes. Uh, meaning the volume yesterday was around 1 million. Today is around 23 million. But the price is still negative. Yes. That means the volume has picked up, the price has not yet picked up. So you expect the price to catch up? Yes. Uh, not, not all the time but there is a signal. So now if we see today, what is going on with DUSD, you will know, uh, that if it is still in the top 10, uh, or what is, uh, here we can look at the daily chart. On DUSD. Uh, Yeah, you see yesterday there was a huge volume spike on DUSD. Yes, I see. So even though the price is down today, uh, like it was up yesterday. It, it closed down but, um, it was up 20% yesterday from low to the high. 25%. So intraday there was Yeah, I'm looking at the five minute charts on that now. See the volume coming in and it peaks at the at the at the top. Yes. Which, which you would expect. But as long as your signal is generated ahead of that, Yep. then that's cool. And then I guess like, well, I'm, I'm assuming it's like a a bit of a scalp trade. Yeah. So, I don't, anything ranked greater than 20, I don't, I, I was telling this to somebody yesterday for Bananas. Uh, I only put say $1,000 in and that $1,000 I'm willing to donate to the market because of the tail risk. Like it could go down 90% and I will never see any of it. And I should be okay in doing that. Because that could go, that could go 20. So, here, when I took this screenshot, Banana was up 51%. So, that is like an outsized return. Say $500 return on a $1,000 trade. Uh, I'm definitely not capturing the lows and the highs. But I want to be able to capture the meat of the move. Like if it moves 20%, I want to capture 15 out of it. If it capture, if it moves 50%, I want to capture say 30 or 40% out of it. Yeah, okay. I imagine this kind of a strategy you'd have to backtest a lot of the permutations of it, right? Because that that volume signal has many points where it could be generated, right? Like if you're Right. That's you can't backtest on a single asset because it randomly, market makers randomly choose or I don't know what their logic is. So, you have to run it across all 460 to see which one has the volume change. Because otherwise you're picking with your hindsight bias and that doesn't essentially work. Yeah. But but that's what I mean, right? Like like you have to backtest using your entire database. You're you're testing the whole market universe every day. At the, at the time, yes. Yeah. Have you been able to do that? Yes. Okay, that's cool. Uh you could Because you could get in because because the question is like when when do you start buying in, like if if the volume is up or 200% up. Right? So the rank is only valuable if you can rank across multi, and so I could not, I could not do this on a one-minute candle because the exchange does not give me the volume in USD. The exchange gives me the volume in the base asset. Yeah. To do this, to compare all the assets and their volume daily, I need to convert that to USD. A standard. And then, once I have converted that into USD, then I can rank them across volume, like what is the volume for the asset for the day and how do 460 rank. And then there is also some, uh, edge in the delta. So, if you see, um, actually all of them. The delta, the CVD is negative. Yeah. Limit bids. Yes. No, not limit bids. It's just people taking profits and the price is still up. Yeah. Well, it has to be, right? If the price is up but the CVD is negative, it it has to be it has to be the bid walking up the price. Yeah. So, so the signal is, is in, do you just like look at the top 20 and and just pick the ones to trade or or are you looking for the ones that have the biggest volume percent change? Um, so let me share the entire screenshot. Up. Okay. Or or you could also, you could also base it on, I don't know if there's a signal here, like, um, you could look at which assets are climbing up the rankings the fastest. Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. Now you're getting, now you're getting the hang of it. Yeah. That is, that is the edge. When an asset climbs up in ranking, uh, some, some asset, it, it doesn't matter if it climbs up in ranking from, uh, 25 to 22. But it matters a lot if it is moving from, say, 220 to less than 100. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. But how can you get that unless you have the entire view of the market in real time? Great question. Yeah, I don't think you can. If you're looking at one asset at the, okay, look at this. Omni USDT today. It is up 84%. Yeah. Um, the volume percentage change on that is, uh, 2000. So, like four digit volume percentage change. It is in the top, top 10. Like Omni USDT is in top 10. Crazy to me. So, I think you'd have to, see this is interesting. I've got an observation on Omni here that I, I'm gonna share. Okay, look at it, but now, sorry, David, to interrupt. Um, because you asked, because now you understand what the logic is behind this screener, I can share the entire screenshot. Initially, I only shared bits and pieces because one there was no interest and people didn't actually understand what they were looking at. But now you're looking at it and you understand that going up in ranking means the volume is increasing. Yeah, exactly. And so now, the first table you see is by volume descending, simple, rank 1 to 20. Yeah, I see. The second, this is just the same data frame printed in three different tables. There's one more table after that, but it is not very important. Uh, the second one is volume percentage change, which is sorted by volume percentage change, as it says. And then the third table is sorted by price percentage change. So the highest price is the top, top one. Okay. And this runs, this runs every 30 seconds. So, when I get a new 30-second candle generated in my database based on the ticks. So, look at this on the top right corner. Uh, this screenshot is from 16, 4 p.m., 4:19 p.m. and 03 seconds. But it has data until 4:16, 4:19:00. Like if you see in the screenshot, it says time now today, Yeah. It has data up till that period. So every, it runs every 15 seconds, this script and shows me the exact, uh, outlook of what is happening in the market. Like I don't need to look at the chart. I can just look at this and tell you what is moving. BTC, ETH has two X the volume of BTC. Like ETH volume today is $8 billion versus BTC is $9 billion. How it was yesterday. Yesterday at this time, ETH volume was $18 billion, 18.5. So, it is a little lower today. So, this I think, I think you, we might be generating some similar signals because if something like Omni where it's doing absolutely nothing, then out of nowhere it just explodes, the funding rate signal, um, well, the funding rate signal fired at basically the same time. So fired on that at the top of that first big five-minute candle. The first expensive five-minute candle. Uh, I don't know where it would have triggered on a lower time frame because we're not we're not using a lower time frame, but it might have triggered even sooner, I don't know. Um. And then if we just work with the five-minute for example. And then if you and if you go long on the top of that on the close of that candle, then you get a momentum, you get a momentum follow through of another 15% right there. And that's Okay. It's a bit of an outlier I know because of how fast it is. But if if your system would have bought that, uh we we would have bought that too. I think we did buy that. Yeah, you see a massive drawdown. No. On the funding rate. Yeah. No. In general, like, so, uh, and I'll, looking for because, uh, how do I do this? Because this is an anomaly. Uh, not all the volume spikes happen like this. Because this one is unusual. Uh, Yeah, it's a very fast one. Yeah, that is a bit of a weird one. And so I'm looking at a 30-second chart. And the reason I'm looking at a 30-second chart is, I, I'm not trading HFT and so I'm waiting until a new 30-second candle shows up in my database. And so if you enter after the first 30-second candle, you you may still be barely able to just break even. Because there was no signal before the 30-second candle. Does that make sense? That makes sense. Uh I guess it depends how fast you're trading this. I mean that first 30-second candle, it looks like it's closing around about $5. Yes. So if you're getting in anywhere close to $5, and you can trade it up to $7, That's hindsight, David. We don't know if it'll pull back or if you So so so that's that's my question. Like is it possible to backtest the the behavior of these of these things? And how do you how do you like how do you enter and exit these once you get a signal? Uh, I enter, right now my entry is manual. So, I enter with a with a manual entry and a and a tight stop loss. Even yesterday, I took a trade on Bananas, uh, and rode up like 6, 7%, but that was me manually trailing the stop loss. It's not systematic. I have not been I have not converted this into a There is an edge but I've not had the time to convert it into a systematic. Okay. Edge where I leave it and let it go on its own. So, so you're in a very similar place to us on the funding rate strategy is is what it seems like to me. Um, because our So, like so for us for example, um, the idea is once once we get the signal, we we want to we want to be long that market once our signal fires. Mhm. Then in terms of getting out, um, so it will close an open position once the signal, um, is no longer valid, if we still have the open position. But, Okay. if if we let it run unattended, which is is what we've actually done for the last two, three days, um, it's really not not working as as good as when it's traded manually. Um, so it sounds like we're in a similar position actually to you then. So the one strategy to combat that, and this is what I learned from, this is what I learned from Scott Phillips, is as you have new data coming in, you adjust your position every minute. You can't just So when you generate the signal, it can't just be a binary long or short. It has to be adaptive to the new information coming in. So, say it went up, in the next 30-second candle, it went up 30% or 5%. You you change your stop loss and you move your stop loss. So it's, the system should automatically have a trailing stop loss. Yeah, indeed. And, and there should be no take, there should be no take profit. Your exit out of the trade should be based on the stop loss. So, then your stop loss is in profit. Yes, in profit, in profit 2%, in profit 4%, in profit 6%. That has to be adaptive to the new market information that is coming in. And when you got So, so that's that's my question to you Q. So so for your strategy, uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but but I, you know, I think you're obviously you're buying these and it's and it's a momentum, it's a momentum long with some kind of trailing stop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I mean that that's basically how we would manually trade ours as well. Yes. Um, the only sort of comment ours does have a profitable backtest with with no management, uh, but it's no but it's not as profitable. Sorry, who? Uh, the funding rate, the funding rate trade. I'm, I'm sorry, I'm not following. Can you say that again, please? So I'm, I was just I was just doing a comparison of of of your of your your trade, um, with the the trade that we do using the funding rate. Um, it's a different it's a different signal, but but it's a very similar trade, I think. Um, it it has a lot of momentum early on.\ngetting uh extreme, they'll change those intervals um, just without warning. Oh, wow. Okay. So this was something that um, Naman had to do quite a lot of work on, uh, because it was it was messing really messing with our system at first, because, you know, they would they would publish a funding rate, but they they weren't publishing what the what the interval was. So if they say the funding rate is two, and that's based on eight hours, and then if it if it remains at two, but they change it to four hours, then it's actually four, right? Because it's uh, it's 2% every four hours instead of every eight hours. Um, but unless we know that they've updated it, we couldn't adjust for it. Yeah. And Naman did find a solution to to that in the end, but um, that was one of the complicating factors. And so, so, The other thing I'm experiencing right now, if we want to back test, uh, any strategy, we should only back test on Bitcoin and see if it is profitable. Reason being, that if you even do it on ETH or SOL, you're bringing your hindsight bias in. Meaning, you know, that SOL and ETH, uh, have better reflexivity than BTC. Or the second option, if you really want to back test a strategy is to back test across all the assets at the same time, and have your strategy pick the assets based on the market information, the rank, whatever your logic is. Uh, and only then it will be able to pick the right asset across all the assets. Otherwise, you're you're always introducing your hindsight bias in into the strategy. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. And so the second option is much complicated, much harder to do, uh, as a single developer. Uh, that means you're competing against the hedge fund teams who are doing this for a living, and who have much more expertise than you do. And they have much more, uh, data, much more complex systems, uh, than you do. And so, I would personally only back test on BTC. Uh, see how the results are, add fees in to make sure that you're not getting you're not thinking that your strategy is profitable, but when you actually bring it live, it is not. Yes. Especially on especially on these momentum strategies, because momentum strategies, you bring in a lot of hindsight bias. Like I I back tested a strategy on WIF, and the Sharpe ratio was in like six digits. That is impossible. Hmm. Because Sharpe ratio greater than two, people will pay you millions of dollars. But the reason I was back testing it on WIF was because I already knew that it had uh, crazy returns on that strategy. Yeah, interesting. Interesting. I think, yeah, with these kinds of breakout strategies, I think you have to be very fast. You have to be very fast. Uh, do you want to automate it, Q? I I would love to. But before I automate it, I would love to back test it, uh, to see if uh, even something as basic as the change in rank, like we discussed earlier, is an entry signal. Because the change in rank is the change in relative volume across all the assets. So, an asset going from rank 200 to 100, meaning that people even though there's no signal on the asset itself, it is a signal in itself that it moved up the rank from 200 to 100. Yeah, that that's very significant. So, I've just got a just to change the subject very quickly. Mm-hm. Just got a signal on uh, Popcat, actually. Okay. Uh, Yeah, so the price is touching the 200 the 200-day moving average, uh, and the yearly VWAP It's not it's not quite overlapping, actually. The yearly VWAP is 2% below. Um, So I think that's a that's a significant signal. At least according to um, according to D-speed. Yeah. Um, Let me ask, uh, Naman, are you still there, Naman? Oh, yes, yeah. But I have to let Naman We'll let you go soon, Naman. Sorry. I know it's very late. Um, Naman, can you remember when we did the back test of um, overlapping levels? What what was the um, what was the uh, the range, uh, tolerance, um, that they had to be within to be considered overlapping? So, we actually tested the multiple ranges. And I think, uh, the best performing ones was 1.4, sorry, 0.4. Okay. So, well, these these are this is two. These are 2% apart. So, it doesn't quite qualify then. Yes. Is this a there's a random a random shitcoin that uh, has uh, the yearly VWAP and the 200-day moving average, um, uh, they're 2% apart from one another. And the price is just interacting with the moving average now. That's pretty far. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's basically just Yeah, yes, I just said that it's very far from like usual what we tested. Okay. So, probably not not much signal here. It's basically just testing that for support right now since everything across the board is dumping. Yeah. Uh, David, what what percentage of your trades, you said you were short ETH earlier, what percentage of your trades are systematic versus uh, discretionary? Oh, it's all it's all discretionary. Um, I mean, aside from what we're working on, uh, Naman and I, uh, everything is discretionary. Okay. Yeah, and what about for you, Q? Yeah, it's mostly discretionary. I get my signals based on the volume change, momentum change. Uh, but at the end of the day, I And then once I built this screener and the momentum breakout and I I actually because this is very hard to see. Uh, you don't see a 19,000% change in volume, unless you compare it across all the assets and you compare it across the same time yesterday. And so, once I saw this, I was like, okay, probably there is an edge here that we can look at and exploit. Uh, and if anything, we can immediately as soon as the price moves up 1 or 2%, we can bring the stop-loss to break even. At least that way, you're saving your capital and yourself from a drawdown. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. So, so, that is something that I want to, um, if anything, and if you have time and interest, I can share the code. Uh, this is not in a UI, this is still outputting on the command line. So, what we can do is, we can we can generate a dashboard that updates automatically, and you and I can look at it. Because there's already all this data in the underlying database, we just need to and the queries are ready, everything is ready. We just need to create the UI for it. If that is something that you're interested in, and so if you click on one of those symbols, it opens up the chart for you. Mammee. Okay. Yeah, I think I'd be very interested. And if it's possible if it's possible whenever a symbol crosses a threshold or uh, increasing rank or or volume change. Yeah. Um, just to observe it at least and then Yeah, it'd be interesting to just to watch it for a week or two. And then I think Yeah, compare notes and maybe formulate some ideas. Yeah, yeah. I think that could be that could be valuable. Yeah. I'm very interested to see if or how often, um, the signals overlap with the funding rate signal as well. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah, so and it might maybe So, the other thing is, um, I would say, if Naman wants to work on, is he can import the funding rates into my database. So that way, he's actively using the database. He's writing queries for it. Um, and he can write a script. I can put it on my server, uh, which automatically collects the funding rate. Uh, which he already has on his system. And so that way, we can bring in the funding rate on this dashboard. Okay. Yeah, that'd be interesting. Yeah. So, again, there's a lot of a lot of scope for where we can collaborate. Uh, for now, we can start with a simple back testing strategy and then and then we can talk more. Okay. Yeah, Q, I think I'm happy with all of that. And then, um, So, lots of, yeah, okay. So, lots of lots of lots of things to do. Um, we'll we'll fall back on the the tasks, the the immediate tasks that we discussed earlier. Yeah. Um, and then, yeah, let's re should we reconvene in uh, in two or three days? Yeah, that's fine. Maybe one more time before Friday should be good. Okay, fantastic. Um, Yeah. And if you don't mind, uh, don't have to do it now, but Naman, if you can share some code of what your strategy is and how it is. Otherwise, there's I'll just be creating another a completely different strategy from what you have and then obviously, the results won't match. So, I want to see if I can recreate your strategy in my back tester. Yeah, I think we can do that. Yeah. Okay, awesome. Um, Okay. I appreciate this call. Thank you. Yeah, likewise, likewise. Let's see what we can do with this. Um, and uh, yeah. We'll, um, stay active on the chat. Um, Yep. And uh, we better go now, because it's uh, well it's it's it's past midnight here. And I I don't want to know what time it is, uh, where I'm sorry if it was a little longer than expected. No, all good. All good. All good. Good, good chat. We used to it. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Awesome. Thanks, Q. Speak soon. Yeah, bye-bye. Bye, guys. Meow. Oh my goodness, fucking done with that now, finally. Yes, he must be dead.",

        "summary": "**Meeting Minutes**\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Participants:** David, Naman, Q\n**Objective:** To review current automated trading strategy performance, discuss new strategy exploration, and outline collaborative technical development for enhanced backtesting and automation.\n\n---\n\n**1. Current Strategy Performance Review (Funding Rate Strategy)**\n*   The automated funding rate strategy, running on AWS, is fully end-to-end hands-off, with the exception of occasional manual profit-taking which has yielded better results than fixed take-profits. This highlights an area for optimization.\n*   The system successfully acted on a recent \"Banana S31 pump,\" indicating its logic is correctly triggering trades based on specified rules (e.g., funding closing below 2%).\n*   Over the past 2-3 days, the automated performance has not matched the effectiveness of manual trading, suggesting a need for more adaptive position management, such as trailing stop-losses.\n*   A past challenge with exchanges changing funding rate intervals without warning has been addressed and resolved by Naman.\n*   David primarily trades discretionary, while the team's automated system requires manual intervention for optimal performance.\n\n**2. New Strategy Exploration & Backtesting**\n\n*   **Ditos/Mean Reversion Strategy:**\n    *   Q is actively working on replicating and backtesting the \"Ditos\" indicator, identified as open-source and based solely on price action (OHLC data), without volume. This indicator was originally derived from a Forex guru's work, adapted for TradingView.\n    *   David's visual observation of price patterns with Ditos, without volume correlation, was confirmed by Q.\n    *   Q's Python-based backtesting framework provides comprehensive statistics (Sharp ratio, Sortino, max drawdown, etc.) and visualization (equity curves). The framework can efficiently test numerous parameter combinations using Numba for optimized performance.\n    *   The team previously conducted rudimentary backtesting on a mean reversion strategy involving clusters of SMAs and VWAPs, showing promise (1% SL, 3% TP, good win rate/profit factor/expectancy over two years). However, this lacked critical performance metrics and was limited to a single market.\n    *   Proposed enhancements include incorporating Ditos pivots as an additional confluence for the mean reversion strategy and exploring other confluences like volume spikes or CVD increases.\n    *   A discussion on backtesting scope suggested prioritizing Bitcoin first to mitigate hindsight bias and overfitting before expanding to other crypto assets or traditional markets, which would require significant data collection.\n    *   The strategy's performance will be analyzed for long-only vs. long/short to assess profitability given individual trading constraints (e.g., Q's spot-only Coinbase access).\n\n*   **Momentum Breakout Strategy (Q's Screener):**\n    *   Q has developed a custom screener that processes 30-second candle data (derived from tick data, including USD buy/sell volume) to identify assets with significant volume percentage changes compared to the same time on the previous day.\n    *   The screener ranks assets by volume, volume percentage change, and price percentage change, providing a real-time market overview every 15-30 seconds.\n    *   A key edge identified is when an asset rapidly climbs in volume rank (e.g., from rank 200 to <100), indicating a potential price movement to follow.\n    *   Currently, this strategy is traded manually by Q with tight stop-losses and trailing stops, but the goal is to automate it, including adaptive trailing stop-losses.\n    *   Backtesting this strategy necessitates analyzing the entire market universe (all 460+ assets on Binance futures) simultaneously to avoid hindsight bias.\n    *   Future development could involve building a dedicated UI/dashboard for the screener, potentially integrating direct exchange execution and displaying funding rates by importing them into Q's database.\n\n**3. Decisions**\n\n*   **Strategy Prioritization:** The Ditos/Mean Reversion strategy will be the primary focus for immediate systematic development and comprehensive backtesting. The momentum breakout strategy is recognized for its potential but will be pursued systematically later.\n*   **Backtesting Process:** Q will implement and backtest the Ditos strategy using their Python framework. David and Naman will simultaneously work on implementing a simpler version of the strategy on TradingView to compare results and familiarize themselves with the tool.\n*   **Code Collaboration:** Naman will share the Python code for the existing mean reversion/cluster strategy backtesting with Q to ensure consistency in replication. Both Q and Naman will consider setting up a GitHub repository for collaborative code sharing.\n*   **Data Integration:** Naman will explore importing funding rates into Q's database for integrated analysis.\n\n**4. Action Items**\n\n*   **Naman:**\n    *   Share Python code for the mean reversion/cluster strategy backtesting with Q to enable replication and comparison.\n    *   Investigate and potentially set up a GitHub repository for collaborative code.\n    *   Explore importing funding rate data into Q's database.\n*   **Q:**\n    *   Continue developing and backtesting the Ditos indicator logic in Python, focusing on generating comprehensive performance statistics (Sharp ratio, max drawdown, etc.) and equity curves.\n    *   Replicate Naman's mean reversion strategy in the Python backtesting framework using the shared code.\n    *   Share Python backtesting library/framework and code on GitHub.\n*   **David & Naman:**\n    *   Familiarize with TradingView's strategy tester by implementing a basic moving average crossover strategy.\n    *   Attempt to implement a version of the Ditos/Mean Reversion strategy on TradingView for comparison.\n\n**5. Next Steps / Follow-ups**\n\n*   Reconvene within 2-3 days (before Friday) to discuss initial backtesting results from both Python and TradingView, compare findings, and plan further parameter tuning and confluence integration.\n*   Future discussions will include the feasibility of developing a custom UI/dashboard for real-time market insights and potential direct exchange execution, as well as the systematic automation of the momentum breakout strategy.",
        "transcript": "on the fundings are our funding stuff. has really traded much. Um I think it's down a little bit over the last two, three days, but Okay. I haven't checked in on it much. We'll we'll do a we'll do a proper review at the end of the week. I see. For now I'm sort of Yeah, I'm I I don't really want to touch it to be honest. Okay. If I look at it too much, I'll just end up interfering with it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So this is it running on AWS and like do you have an end-to-end like you're completely hands off on it. Naman, could you answer that please? Uh yeah, it's actually completely automated from uh start to end. Uh just one thing that I think we are manually managing sometimes that take profits. Uh because Um I think it was better in terms of taking manual take profits instead of fixed. I see. Yeah, probably true actually. Yeah. Yeah, one of the things that tends to happen with this is that you get a, I think I mentioned it before, the the maximum favorable excursion. Yeah. It's a lot bigger. Oh, on average, it's much higher than than the actual profit. So, um, yeah, we'll have to optimize it. Um, so I think some manual property taking makes sense. Yeah. Were you able to see the, um, what is it? The Banana S31 pump yesterday. Like, because the funding went negative and so I tagged you on the main chat, but not sure if you guys or the algo acted on it and took the trade. Uh, it was after hours for me, which is why I didn't reply. Um, Oh. No, that's good. We check the logs to see if it traded. I mean if, if the funding closed below two percent, then we would have traded. Yeah. It did actually. I saw it yesterday. Oh, okay, good, good. Yeah, at least so it's picking up, uh, it's picking up assets when your logic hits, uh, whatever that is, like the rules that you have specified. Yeah. That's right. By the way, uh, David, if I may call you that, uh, Hey. Yes. I prefer it. Okay. Uh, there's a green Dito on uh, BTC five-minute. Okay, nice. I'm actually short, um, I'm I'm short ETH right now. Um, so that's interesting. Yeah, so the green Dito is where you take profits, right? Like if you are short. Yeah. There is a green Dito on Eath as well, sorry. Oh, really? Need to have pulled that layout. Oh, maybe Oh, I did not share the layout. Sorry. I'll send it right away. No, it's okay. I'll I'll got something rigged up here. Yeah, I see what you mean. That's probably quite a strong signal. Yeah. Um, with two together like that. Uh, at least take some profits if that makes sense. You should take some off here then and, uh, and I can stop back in lower down. Yeah. By the way, uh, I'm trying to see if I can recreate this Ditos indicator, um, and back test it. He's not shared. He's not shared the source code, but, uh, Yes. It is open source, actually. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. I didn't even know what it's based on. I mean, I've eyeballed it, um, and I couldn't see what it was. I mean, it looks like some sort of swing failure or on on the price action. Yes. I don't I don't know if it incorporates volume or not. Uh, no, it doesn't. It's just price action, OHLC. No volume. Interesting. Okay. Interesting. That was my suspicion. And So, so, you know Inceco, right? The guy Inceco, not the Inceco terminal. What? Um, so that guy that guy was in crypto a long time ago and then he started a Telegram channel uh, where he posted random content, which was like pure Alpha. And, Okay. and then he also started coding indicators on TradingView. So this is one of his indicators on TradingView. Oh, I see. Interesting. But, but it is not his original indicator. He stole this indicator from some Forex guru, uh, who was trading foreign exchange, uh, like currencies. Um, and just converted it to a TradingView script. Okay. All this all this was like seven, eight years ago, nine years ago. How'd you know about this, Q? Uh, somebody was speaking about some on the somebody pointed it out in the group chat, in the voice chat, uh, one time. Oh. And then I looked it up and Lo behold. So, the Vespa indicator has a lot of other things, the levels, but the Ditos itself is a completely separate indicator with the same input, same language, same everything. That's pretty interesting because I don't I don't want to burst his bubble, but, uh, like I'm sure he's made some changes to the indicator, but I don't I'm trying to convert it to my I don't want to be the bad guy and say, hey, you stole this or whatever. Like he's still sharing stuff with us, right? So I want to respect that. Yeah. And there's not many original things, right? When it comes to extracting indicators. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I-you know, Q, it's really interesting because the first time he spoke about it, or it was the first time I heard about it, he said it it was related to volume, um, and I I just I had my doubts about that because I just couldn't see any correlation or any connection to volume whenever I looked at it on a chart. Yeah. Um, but I could see some price patterns. So it's interesting. It's interesting that, uh, you don't see the volume connection either. Right? I'll just share, uh, the exact. Like you see this page. Please keep it to yourself, David. I don't want any issues within the within the group, if that makes sense. 100%. 100%. No, I I I won't I won't share any of this. So if you look at just the screenshot, I see. Yeah. Yeah. That's very, very similar to what And so, this is the TradingView indicator that is open source. Like you can look at it's it's 60 lines of code. Okay. I'm going to wait, let me I'm going to put this on my TradingView now. Yeah. You can you can hide the Vespa indicator and just put the same input like 4060 or 4010 or 60100 or whatever and it will draw the same lines and the same Ditos. Oh, really? Interesting. Okay, that's very interesting. Yeah, okay. So, 40 100. Yeah, even the um the inputs have the same names as well. Yes. Okay, I shouldn't. Yeah, I won't I won't mention anything, Q, don't worry. Okay. Yeah, thanks for sharing that. No, again, I'm not I'm not saying it is bad or whatever, but I'm just trying to convert this into Python to see if, uh, we can systematically find an edge there, like with a tight stop loss. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Because the input he's given us, which is 4060 or 60100, uh, they are different from the default inputs, which is like 4010 on the indicator. Yes. Um, and and I want to see over time if those indicators, like we're not trying to overfit, but we want to actually fit to and this source code was is from 2019, like if you see the date. So that's like six years old. Yeah. And the way actually I found it also I confirmed it was, uh, he he liked or if you go on his profile, he liked this indicator itself and that looks very similar to Vespa and so I was like, okay, if he's liked it, he's not commented on on the TradingView screen or anything. He's just like it and so, uh, and if you search for the name, there is actually a few like other platforms that use the same indicator for trading. Hmm. That's some very good sloothing. I mean, I'm not spoofing. I just wanted to see what the juice is and like trying to replicate it. Yeah. No, that's cool. I mean, I I wondered about it myself. Um, I just had no idea how to actually go about figuring that out. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, that's very interesting because, um, Naman and I did some stats, uh, a few weeks ago and we were looking at the the moving averages and the VWAPs. Yeah. Um, and, uh, well, so I I I'll share another secret with you then, uh, Q. Uh, I I shared a screenshot of of the equity curve, um, uh, the D speed shared and, um, and I said to I said to Naman, like, you know, this, um, this is an automated strategy. It's based on VWAPs and SMAs. Uh, and and we started trying to figure out ways to, um, replicate that or or work out our own strategy. Mhm. Um, we didn't we didn't really we didn't do anything on it yet because, um, we we focused our efforts getting the funding rate strategy running. Yes. Um, but we did do some stats on it. Um, Naman did some stats that were quite cool. Um, So sorry if you if you don't mind me asking. So you just shared the equity curve that he posted with Naman. Well, the the screenshot. Just just basically Just just to show. I mean, he didn't say anything about what the strategy was. Yes. He just said it was related to Vespa. So, I was saying to the man, you know, can we do something based on moving averages and VWAPs? And I think that was not Vespa or moving averages. That was basically this indicator because that gives you the entry and the exit signals. Okay. Interested. So we can again, we can, it's not very difficult to do a back testing on TradingView and I can once I finish coding this in Python and I have my data and I run it against my database to see if we are getting similar results on TradingView versus my results and so that way we can compare, uh, if where there are discrepancies, is there a bug in the code in the indicator or is there a bug in the signal or what's wrong? Before we bring before we even consider like, hey, if it is profitable and the equity curve is good before we bring it live, if that makes sense. So, uh, so you're saying we should uh, back test some strategies, Q, is that is that the idea? Yes. So back test on the same strategy, for example, on TradingView versus in Python. Say, Ah, see. So they should match. Ideally, they should match because the underlying data for price action is the same, right? Mhm. Yeah. Um, so the equity curve, the drawdown, everything should be very similar. Yeah. Yeah, they should be the they should be identical, right? Yeah. In theory. Okay. And then, and then on top of that, what TradingView doesn't have, what I have is the buy-sell delta. So we can incorporate those things into the strategy. Like trapped traders, uh, things like that. Because this strategy is just purely based on price action. But then we can add more confluences to improve the entries and the exits. Yeah, I think some confluences would most likely be needed. I think just trading the Ditos on by themselves. Well, I haven't tested it, but I would imagine it's not effective by itself. And so Have you tested that, Q? Just a a a Dorito only strategy? Um, no, I'm still just coding the indicator. I found this over the weekend when I was scrolling. I I didn't I I haven't had a lot of time with the indicator myself. So I have to first code it in Python, try to replicate the same Ditos first in Python before I even back test it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Um, the other thing is, uh, that I want to test is, uh, there are two variables in, um, in the input of the indicator. But there is one other variable that is hard-coded in the function itself. And if Naman wants to see, I can share the source code. But, uh, are you, uh, David, are you in front of the TradingView screen? I can share. Yes, I am. So if you click on the source code, don't open the source code. It'll just open in a small window in the on the screen. Uh, for the indicator, yeah. Yes. Okay. So, line nine and 10 is, uh, the inputs. But then, uh, if you see line 20 and 21, it is comparing close versus like the close of four, meaning the fourth candle before the current candle. Yeah, I see that. So four is hard-coded. We can add that as a variable, like how far do you want the look back to be? Ah, okay. So that way we can make my my, uh, back testing library that I use, uh, can identify, can loop through all these inputs. So I can in the first input, instead of just doing 40, I can do 40, 50, 60, 70 up to 100. The second input I can do 10, 20, 30 up to 100. The third input I can do three, four, five, six, or whatever I can pass in a list and then it will loop through all of those, uh, permutations and combinations and tell me for this asset, which is the best it is over fitting. But for this asset, which is the best, uh, inputs that you can use and we can use those inputs on because right now we need to use TradingView for visualization. I don't have I don't have, uh, like UI built in into my coding, my trading system. So, until then, we can use those inputs to visualize what is going on on the indicator itself. Okay. Am I am I clear? Am I vague? Sorry. So, what I think so I'm I'm I'm not an expert when it comes to the Templar stuff with you. So what I'm what I'm what I'm hearing is you're suggesting that we adjust the indicator so that we can adjust this extra variable and then just experiment with it visually on TradingView. Yes. Uh, no, I will experiment in the back end with my back testing framework, which will give me, which will tell me, hey, these are the good inputs that you should use, uh, will perform the best based on the back test. And then we we put those numbers in to see what is actually happening on TradingView. I see. Okay, yeah, I see. I see. And then we could do like a a strategy on TradingView with those parameters. Yes. Okay, got it. That makes sense. Um. And then we can add more confluences like levels, predefined levels like yearly VWAP, 200 day moving average or or, uh, even the high time frame and low time frame indicators. Like, uh, high time like you were saying, D Wall, I think that's what you said. Uh. You said something like we need to get into a low time frame, uh, our wall to see to to perfect our entries and exits. Well, that was just one one suggestion. Yeah. So, Q, um, Naman, could you do me a favor? Could you please, um, get the stats, uh, that we have for the, um, the the SMA and and the VWAP uh, fading strategy and put them on the chat here? Oh, shipping, sir. Just give. Uh, share. I will just, uh, give me a minute, please. Yeah, no, worries. Thank you. So, I mean, So I guess there's different strategies, right, Q? So, uh, when it comes to the big when it comes to the the VWAPs and the SMAs, Uh-huh. when you trade and and trading when they're when they're overlapping one one another. I think that's fundamentally a a fading strategy, right? Um. And we've got some basic stats on that. It's it's a just a starting point for now. Um, but, uh, you'll have a look at them in a moment and I think there's something there. And then if we wanted to add confluences to that, I suppose they'd have to be confluences that make sense, right? So I I was just brainstorming here, um, of some indicators that could add add conviction. Um. We haven't tested it, but it stands to reason that, um, if if if, um, a cluster of, um, of SMAs and VWAPs, um, are going to be strong support or strong resistance and they're going to hold. There should be some kind of spike in volume at least at least on the low time frame or or some noticeable increase. I think something like that might be worth testing. Okay. Um. Especially because it's probably quite easy to test. Um, and you could go infinitely more complex, like, um, we could start, you know, looking at like some CBD, um, some increases in in volume Delta. Um, my only concern with stuff like that is that if it starts getting too complex, um, then you're, you know, you you start overfitting. Um, and and Yes. once it gets too complex, it probably just doesn't work. So, the other strategy I was thinking after so, one thing I say we do is we prioritize which strategy do we want to go for first, which is either we do, uh, the Vespa, uh, Ditos, or, uh, those are the two that I was most recently working on, which is why I'm saying that or the momentum breakout strategy, which is, uh, like alls flying 30, 40 percent and we capture the upside on those. So which one should we prioritize? Uh, I don't want to go, uh, in all directions and like not make any progress. So I would rather stick with one. We we find the results and see if there's something there for us and we make progress that way. Yeah, I completely agree. I completely agree with that. Um. Oh, by the way, uh, sorry, one other thing. I don't have access. So Naman, if you can grant me that email address that I shared earlier. Yeah, just a second. So Q, um, a note on these statistics. Um, Uh-huh. Uh, same same comment that you made actually before like because this, um, this this work sort of belongs to D speed. So, um, Yes. I did actually share this with him. Um, Okay. when we did it. Um, and I said, I I and I only shared it with him, uh, and I just just said, look, you know, this is this is your thing. So I'm not putting it on the group, right? Uh, same thing same thing that you said. Um. Yeah. Um, and and we left it at that. Um, I thought I thought he might be interested in sort of working on something automated, but, um, I don't know, I tried to catch up with him a couple of times. Um, I don't think it's a priority for him right now. Yeah. I think, at least what I am assuming that he's just doing this because he's passionate, not because he needs the money for, uh, for his day-to-day life. Like he's had, uh, he has enough resources that he could care less about optimizing a strategy, which like he doesn't need this for a living. Like he doesn't want to spend more efforts than it is necessary. It seems that way to me. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think, um, well, it's something we can discuss later, Q. Yeah. Uh, what I what I, I mean, I I would probably, well, we can discuss it. I mean, I would probably want to sort of let him know what progress we're making, what we're doing, um, out of just uh, courtesy, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so this is one setup. Right? Yeah. It's one setup. So, if you, so the the the first page is just kind of like the explanation and then the statistics tab on the left, if you can see that. Yeah. So, that's got the statistics on it. Um, so, what we were basically looking at here was, um, a very very basic mean reversion strategy. So, fading the 200 MA, for example. Uh, I think I think we've got a few different levels mentioned in this document. Uh, quarterly VWAP. And then I do believe there's going to be, um, an overlapping levels strategy as well. That had the best And that had the yeah, here we go. So if you towards the bottom, uh, clustered indicators. Can I, uh, share my screen, if that is easier? I think you are on the wrong page, WQ. Uh, it needs to be on the statistics page. Yeah, I'm on the statistics page. I'm on I'm looking at Ethen, so. So if you scroll all the way to the bottom, Yeah. So, the the final, uh, black black box with the table of figures on it, uh, top scenarios. Yes. I see it. Combined long short. So, this is kind of this is the best the the best, uh, most basic back test that we did. Mhm. And this is quite rudimentary, but it's a a cluster of three, um, of three overlapping, uh, levels. And it can be any levels, right? So, uh, any any combination of of three, uh, SMAs and VWAPs. Okay. And then you're your fading fading a touch of that cluster. Yeah. And then you see, uh, so, for the back test you got the 1% stop loss, 3% take profit. Uh, win rate, profit factor, and expectancy. Yeah. So there's definitely something there. There's definitely something there. Um, Naman, do you remember, um, how far back this back test goes? Um, I don't think it was I don't think it was Yeah. two years or three years, maybe. Yes, it was two years. Okay. so, so Q, it's that that's not that's not a very large number of trades for two years, right? But but also it is only it's it's it's also only one market. Yes. But so, sorry, quick question. Do you know say, uh, like what are the numbers, what is the the sharp or the sort of of this strategy or what is what is the starting capital and the max drawdown and what is the ending ending capital with and without fees. So that way we know yes, this stat these stats are good, but without those numbers, it is hard for us to visualize what the equity curve for that strategy is going to be because since this is all 100% automated. Indeed. I'm not sure if we have those. Uh Naman, yeah. Can you answer that, please? Yes, I think we were in the early stage of testing this. So we were just applying some Monte Carlo principles, uh, trying out random things and, uh, figuring out what could work best. Okay. We haven't went towards that and switched towards another project instead. I see. Okay. So, uh, David, it feels like yes, there's something there, but but we need, Hello. And and I'll share one of my strategies, one of my very basic strategies and how I do, uh, my back testing and I will share the output of that back testing framework. Um, and I can actually share it in the chat right now, one sec. So that gives us more comprehensive, uh, information. So, so what happens is,\nwhen you back test. So, first step is coding an indicator. Once you code an indicator, you generate signals based on that indicator. Or regardless how you code an indicator, you generate signals based on whatever your rules are and whatever your criterias are. And and when you pass that information to the back testing framework, it tells you when it takes the trade. Uh when it gets stopped out, or when it gets uh exited into take profit. And then, at the end of it, uh when the entire time series passes through, it gives you the stats of how profitable the strategy is. So, you can do that with fees, without fees, and then it gives you, if you want, you can plot the price and the equity curve, uh like how D-Speed shared. Uh in Python. And so, you can actually visualize, hey, this is the time it took a trade. It actually gives you the timestamp of when the criteria met and you actually entered the trade. So you, it is as if you're looking at a strategy performing live, but on historical data. Yeah. Yeah. And you do this on trading view? No, no, no. This is all in Python in my in my application. Oh, nice. Okay. You have created a library also? Uh, yes. So, I do have a a few different libraries that I use, uh to get this information. So, this is what I worked on last two, three years. Uh when I was doing all the data collection and all the stuff that I did for my uh my database. So, like I already have some pre-calculated indicators in the database. So, like moving average. Yes, it is not taking time, but if you were to always calculate for 400 assets on like, say, four or five different time frames, that takes time. Um, Yeah. And and then it is also optimized to run faster. So, uh Yeah, we can we can go in detail about that, but like I'll just share uh the exact uh output of what the indicator or what the back testing library gives me. Okay. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, this sounds good, but without without the um the sharp ratio, the starting capital, the ending capital, or sorry, where you're ending, you don't know actually if the strategy is profitable or not. Okay. So, in that case, um, if if you agree that this is worth pursuing, then it sounds to me like we have a pathway, uh, to move forward. So, do you want to do So, then this is the third strategy on top of the Doritos, the the momentum breakout on alls. And this is like adding Do you want to add this as a confluence to the first two, or do you want to, uh do you want to add this as a completely separate strategy? To me, it seems like a separate strategy. Um, Okay. In terms of the alts breakout, um, I don't actually know how you're trading that, Q. I mean, is that is that deployed right now? Is it something you're doing? No, I it's not automated. I'm getting alerts, um, and based on those alerts, I act on it. Okay. Is and is it working for you? Yes. Okay. Okay, well, that's good. Um, I think it would be different. Um, to be honest, I think it's a separate strategy. Okay. Um, so, we could treat them, I mean, we could focus on the personal on the alt breakout if if that's all already working. Um, Or we could do, yeah, I'm I'm I'm quite open, Q, to be honest. Um, I'm quite open in terms of the order. All right. Um, so I am personally working on, uh, the Doritos. I've shared the code with you. If you want to work on it, that's fine. Or we can, uh, converge, uh, like you guys can go ahead with a different strategy. You already have access to my database. So, um, if you want to code it in trading view or Python, that's up to you. Uh, I'm going to definitely or what we can do is, you convert this uh indicator into a trading view strategy and I do that on my side on Python, and then maybe in a day or two, we come back and compare our results. So, okay. So, we turn Doritos into a uh Python script and then back test it. Is that what you mean? That is what I am doing. And you guys do the same thing on TradingView because TradingView back testing there's an option on TradingView back testing. that D-Speed shared. Yeah, I think that's doable. Um, Yeah. I'm just trying to think, because I know that TradingView back testing has some limitations. Um, Yes. It has a lot of like you can't in terms of conditions and stuff, it's very limited. But I think if, because what we'd want to do is we we'd want to to give it all of these levels and say, look, if any three of them are within, say, half a percent of one another, then then you fade that level if the price touches it. Yes. That's the basic strategy, right? So, I don't, no, no. So, Um, I actually, um, and no one can I don't know. No one. Have you used the strategy tester on TradingView? Uh, yes. I have used it. But uh, I'm not really the most fond of it as it gives less less flexibility than Python. So, I would prefer that for now. Yes. So, or what we can do is, um, I don't mind working in Python, both of us working together. Just that I don't have a very good way to visualize it. When I give when my back testing gives an output, it is like line by line of what the equity curve looks like and line by line of what trades it takes. So, there's no good way for me to visualize what is going on, which is why I was sticking with TradingView. But that's okay. We don't have to stick with TradingView. Um, uh, may no, like if you can explain like what kind of output you receive? Yes. I I was trying to find one, um, and just paste it in the chat. Give me one minute. I can do that. Or I can do this, uh, in like 5, 10 minutes after the call. I have to find that code, uh, and I'll run it against my, um, so I was testing a rolling VWAP strategy. Um, after the after working with horse. Uh, to see if there's any anything we can extract from there. Uh, no worries. Actually, uh, it would be okay if you just verbally share it, like is it like a CSV of all the trade logs or is it like, uh, some like Yeah, so it's not it's not a CSV. It just prints on the standard output. Oh, got it. Yeah. So, I have a Python program I run which gets the data, uh, generates the signals, and then against that data, it back tests everything, and then gives you an output of all the trades. And then, um, you can also, uh, do Matplotlib or Plotly integration and plot that time series to be able to see what is going on. Yeah, I understand. That's what I was thinking about. Like, it's pretty easy. You can just load it in, uh, uh, PD DataFrame. Yeah. Yes. So, it is in a Pandas DataFrame. That's the input for the back tester. Uh, the time series, one time series is the price. The other time series is a signal. Um, and then it outputs, uh, what trades it took and what what was the profit factor, what was the sortino, what was the sharp ratio, all of that. Yeah, I get it. So, in Python where we use like a print function for the standard output, we can just replace it with like, uh, uh storing it, appending it to a Pandas data frame and then, uh, visualize it quickly. Yep, yep, yep. Yeah. So, uh, David, if you don't mind, do you do you want us, do you think me and, uh, Naman can work together on this, uh, Doritos and then we add more confluence like other other SMAs and EMAs? I think so, yeah. And are you are you in sort of in general agreement, um, about the style of the strategy, that that it's it's a fighting strategy? I would say it's a mean reversion strategy now. Yeah, mean reversion, yeah. So, so when the price touches those clusters of levels, then we would be, yeah, we'd be fading it and looking for mean reversion. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Okay, perfect. Yeah, I just want to make sure we're on the same page. Yeah. Um, and then to be honest, I think if we can add the the Dorito pivots as an additional level to work with, I think that's that's probably going to be very good. Okay. So, uh, Naman, do you have, uh, a notebook or a Python script where you're you ran these stats on, like, uh, because this is Monte Carlo is not as useful. It's just random. So, um, even though you're running it on a higher time frame or multiple different times, um, I don't know if it is accurate enough to predict how the markets will react. Like, or will the markets react the same way? So, I would instead, I would instead fit it on the existing Pandas series, uh, of data to see what what, um, EMAs and SMAs work better against it. Um, just just to clarify quickly, uh, it's not using, uh, randomly created market data. Instead, uh, it's using the actual, uh, uh, historical data. Uh, but, uh, the parameters which we are testing like, uh, stop loss and take profit and other stuff like that, uh, those are usually the random instead. I see. Yes. And also the clusters we are trying to test out, like, uh, how you told like we can test multiple clusters from two to three to five and something like that. Got it. Got it. Um, yeah. So, if you don't mind. So, the other thing, Naman, do you have like a GitHub repository where you're keeping all this code? Um, I don't mind sharing my repository where I have, um, all of my work with the indicators and all that stuff. Um, and so, that way, if you want to collaborate that way, or we can start a completely new repository and that's fine too. Um, I don't have a repo, but, uh, because I'm working mostly locally. So, Okay. Uh, I can create one. Um, No, that's fine. Um, the other thing is, uh, David, how are you interested or how much does it interest you to do the TradingView integration on on our application? Like not on TradingView TradingView on like the source code that I have from a few years ago in Angular React and we integrate that into into our database. I need to understand, um, a little bit better, um, how we're going to use that and what is the benefits of that? Um, so TradingView right now does not give us the delta, meaning the footprint delta. Yes. So, it cannot give us, uh, but since I have all that data in my local database, we can plot that on the existing we can change the code of the existing TradingView library and add that as a functionality to be able to visualize the delta. Like how have you used MMT before? Yes, yeah. Okay. So, so we could get, would it look like a TradingView UI but with added added data that we can put into it? Yes. Oh, I see. Okay, that's very cool. Um, But then, but then on top of it, if we spend more time, we can add execution directly to the exchange from it. So, like if you want. So, have you used InSilico terminal also, right? Yes, many times. Yes. So, this can be your personal InSilico terminal where the UI directly connects to the exchange and you can trade, take trades from the TradingView that you're looking at. So, that TradingView won't be the TradingView website. It will look exactly like TradingView, but you're taking trades off of your This this will be integrated as your own application, like how MMT is. I see. Um, I'm open to it. Um, Okay. And I mean, um, as and when it's necessary, yeah. I mean, at at the moment, I guess it would just be for an ex to add some extra indicators. Um, yeah, I'm open to it. Um, I don't have much experience with that kind of thing. So, I think I'd probably not make it the priority right now, unless it's going to add anything of what we're doing. Yeah. Um, I think if if I'm understanding correctly, I think the priorities now should be, um, for us to well, as you suggested, Q, we need to run some more data on this on this strategy, incorporate the Dorito pivot levels. Um, and tweak the parameters in the way that you described. Um, and then then get some equity curves. Um, If we're able to back test a lot of different scenarios, um, quite efficiently, it might be worth going outside of crypto as well and looking at single name stocks. Yes. Yes. Um, and some commodities as as well, maybe. But I do not unfortunately have, uh, the data for it. So, we have to spend time collecting and storing that data in the database. I see. Before before we back test it. Um, because back testing is not difficult. Collecting the data, cleaning that up, making sure it's usable is the difficult part. Okay, I see. Q, if we if you agree, should we just focus on crypto for now? Uh, make it work here. And then all this stuff we'll roll out later. Yes. Yes. I like that because, so, the other thing is, in my back testing, we can, so, and I'm just trying to be a devil's advocate. Please don't think that I'm trying to cut your strategy apart or say it's not profitable. That's my job as a teammate to critique your work, and I would expect you to do the same for me. Um, like if there's something I bring up to the the same thing what D-Speed did to your funding strategy on the call. Um, which is, we don't know what percentage of, so, I'm looking at the the document Naman shared. Um, it says 186 trades. We don't know what percentage of those 86 are longs versus shorts. Yes. So, and the reason I bring that up is because say, for someone like me, I don't know, um, I don't have the ability to short, because I'm I'm on Coinbase and I'm only using spot. So, I want the strategy to be long only because that is the only option I get, uh, that is the only option I get, uh, on Coinbase. Okay. That's interesting. I mean, That we we'll have to see if that's a limitation or or not. And I know on one of the data sets, um, I don't know if we did it for the for the clusters, um, but when we tested, when we tested touches of a single level, uh, we tested the 200-day moving and the yearly VWAP. And there was a significant difference in performance, uh, longs versus shorts. And, um, I don't remember which one was the higher performer. It may it may even have been shorts, actually. Got it. Um, Um, but Q, I'd just make a comment on that. Um, there's many ways as a US citizen, um, for you to get access to these other perp exchanges. Um, and we can go into it at some point. Um, Sure. I mean, if if if you have a if you've got a profitable strategy that requires you to short, um, I wouldn't see that as a um, as a road block. Okay. You you've probably you've probably gathered from what a lot of the other guys have mentioned, you know, there's ways there's ways and means. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I I have, um, and so the same thing that happened with Hype today, like there's there's cases. You know, even Bybit got hacked for a couple billion dollars, right? Uh, I mean. Yes. And and so there is always going to be that counterparty risk that will always loom in the back of your mind. Like this is not been the first hack. We've had Bitfinex, we've had FTX, we've had Bybit, now there's rumors about Hype and what is going on on Hype. So, so, the point being that yes, even though we have those avenues, we can't put size on there. Like I don't even put size on Coinbase, let alone, uh, an offshore exchange like Binance or Bybit. Yes, they are they're they're reputable, but but, um, we can instead use margin, like how D-Speed is using to increase the position size instead of putting more capital there. And paying the paying the funding price. funding fees. Because that makes sense if your strategy is profitable. You don't need to worry about your position size. Okay. That that that's the never-ending headache of this industry. Uh Yes. Yeah, I mean, everything everything's on leverage. Uh, absolute minimum, minimum collateral for for whatever you're doing is is is the norm for for good reason, for good reason, as you say. Yeah. I mean, we we I mean, just for context, I mean, anything we do, we keep the bare minimum, uh, collateral, uh, required for for whatever is needed. Yeah. And and and also, you know, we can trade. You can trade on like 50X leverage on on most exchanges. So, it's not you know, it's you can make it work. You can make it work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just an unfortunately, that's the never-ending hazard in this business. Not not on Coinbase. I cannot because I have to put for a $50,000 position, I have to put $50,000. Uh that sucks. That sucks. On spot. On spot, but that's that's yeah. That's not capital efficient. Oh, it's not indeed. Yeah. No, I mean, um, yeah. Uh, I I'd say yeah, put a pin in it, Q. It would be my my take on that. Um, and and there's there's ways and means. If if you've got a profitable strategy, it doesn't need to be a road block. Yes. So, let me let me work on the Doritos, and if you want, if you, Naman, if you have found out, like there are some EMAs that work better, So, how do you generate signals on those EMAs? Um, so, if you can share some code, uh, say, on SOL or ETH, the two assets that you have done analysis on, I can, I can run some, if you are generating signals on the Pandas series, I can run some back testing numbers and see if your numbers match with mine. With the same stop loss, take profit, uh, etcetera, etcetera. Um, uh, sorry, may you please repeat, like, uh, So, um, the document that you shared, the cluster of indicators V7 with EMAs. Uh, cluster three, I don't know what that means. But, like, I can input the stop loss of 1% and take profit of 1%, um, and see what time frame is this on, and then I can I can come up with the same statistics. I can back test what you have already done with my back testing library, and I can bring you the results to see if that strategy is profitable. Uh, sure thing. Actually, uh, it's not really, uh, more like a, um, I would say it's more like a plug-and-play thing where we just plug the data set of any symbol, and it will just do this. And regarding the three things, uh, regarding, um, three clusters, like, it would be, uh, looking for any specific three indicators. So, So, do you mind, do you have time? Do you mind sharing your screen and going over like what do you mean by plug-and-play and what do you where do you input your Pandas series and how does it give you this output? Uh, so we, uh, have it stored like a lot of CSV datas. And how I do it personally is like I just change the file name to the specific CSV and all the code is modular, so it auto-detects everything. Uh, pre-defined. And then we just have to change the symbol name, and it will just automatically do the rest of the job on that specific symbol. So, it was originally made for the Bitcoin, but, uh, I just changed the symbol name and we do it on the other things. Uh Yes, I get it. But like how how is it generating the signals? Like where to long, where to short? Um, if you notice on the main page, like, uh, on the document, there's like given the strategy manual. Uh, we are just, uh, have encoded it. And then, uh, whenever the, uh, signal is generated, we just, uh, go to the data frame and check for if, uh, the strategy is like, uh, in a way like, uh, what's the trade is there. And then, we, uh, simulate the trade on the data set. And then, we capture the result into another data frame, which is, uh, what I usually call it as the trade log. And then, uh, utilize that final trade log and other relevant data to create these all these plots. Um, I I understand what I'm asking is do you mind walking through that process on how you do that or do you mind sharing the code where I can try to replicate the same process here on my end. Uh, sure thing. Just give me a minute, please. Yeah. I actually need to look for the code because, uh, it might be somewhere in my system. Yeah. So, and which is why, uh, a GitHub, uh, repository makes sense because that way, like, if there's some code you're working on, I can review, uh, or you can review my code, and we can collaborate that way. Um, if you have a repository and if you want to push, um, just the code, not your CSVs, because GitHub will not let you push all these CSV data, um, on GitHub. You can keep that local versus just the code can stay, uh, on. And that way, I can add integration to that. Like if it doesn't need to read from CSVs, it can read from my database directly. I get it. Yeah. So, so Q, what do we need to do? Um, if we if we disband, um, and reconvene in a couple of days, Um, what do we need to do? So, I personally feel that I can continue working on I don't I'm trying to understand the strategy, the mean reversion strategy manual that Naman shared, and how it is generating the entry and the exits. Uh, but once I figure that out, meanwhile, and if he's able to share the code with me on how he's generating this information, uh, that way, I can debug line by line of how the entries are generated. Uh, and try to implement the same strategy on my back tester to see if it is giving the exact results. And I can I can bring those, once Naman shares the code, um, I can bring the results out from my back tester to you in like 24-hour period. I see. Until until then, until then, I can keep working on until then I can keep working on the Dorito logic that I was already working on. Uh, it is still a work in progress. I'm not done all the way yet. Okay. And then, uh, what can we do in the meantime as well? Uh, meantime, I would say,\nif you feel comfortable at least uh have your code pushed up into a GitHub repository. So, like all of your previous work, if you don't mind, uh sharing that with me, um and I can share all of my work that I've done and we can see uh that's that's that's not even a big task like it should take half an hour maximum, but uh but like if uh What If you want, I know TradingView does not is not the best, um has its own limitations with strategy testing, but it would be beneficial if you could figure a way out on that, so that way, once I have a strategy tester on my end, we can compare the results between the two. Okay. That would be my that would be my take. Um not sure what your thoughts are on this. Yeah, I think it works. Um And then I think that part's going to be quite easy and then I think the main part is going to be how are we going to um how are we going to develop a process to to backtest and tweak the parameters. Oh, that I I have that already. So, once I have the strategy, um I have to give it a list of inputs and it will give me the list of outputs on which parameters give the best results. Oh, so is it is it able to test all the various different combinations? Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, okay. And I think this is something we've you've done this before as well. I forget what it's called. Um the computationally expensive one. I can't remember. Yeah. Okay. Yes. I have optimized it. It gives me an output in in minutes, not even hours, and uh and the code runs even if you run one combination or if you run 20 uh different combinations, the code doesn't take a long it it doesn't take linearly uh long to run 20 combinations. So, like it's very fast. It's it runs on machine level code. Okay, nice. You have compiled it. Yeah. Yes. So, there is a there's a package called Numba. Do you know Numba? Yes. Yeah, I'm using the same package. Yeah, so you you convert that into Numba and the Numba loops uh are extremely fast on uh um when it converts to machine level code. Um and then I have if I am not able to run it on my laptop, I run it on my desktop. If I'm not able to run it on my desktop, I run it on the main server. It has 256 cores and 1 TB of RAM. So, uh so yeah, like computer is not even a question. It runs it's sitting in my David, it's the database is sitting in my uh one of the bedrooms here at the house. And I have like two ISPs. I have two ISPs. So, I don't pay for cloud at all because that is if I were to store all this in the cloud, it is crazy expensive. Yeah. Yeah. I yeah. Yeah, I know. Okay. Um, okay, good. That's that all sounds um that all sounds uh yeah, very reasonable to um Okay. That works for me. Okay. So, Naman to summarize, um If you don't mind sharing the code on the um on the group chat here in Discord, um I can take that code, backtest it myself in Python. And meanwhile, you can use the same code to see generate signals on TradingView and then we can compare the results on TradingView and I can compare uh I can come up with my results in a day or two. Yeah, sure, I think I will I will dig into my laptop and just find out because it's been a while since I've we worked on this project. Okay. Yes. Q, do you think it's worthwhile if if we try to do the backtest on the TradingView? I mean, at least we will know we are investing time in understanding hey, if it is worthwhile or not. So, at least doing it once is worthwhile. Then we know if it is worth it or not. Okay. Okay, so we'll do that on our end then. You can just do a simple strategy. We don't have to do like a complicated one on TradingView. Like a simple a simple moving average crossover and see how how do you code that strategy in Pine Script on TradingView and you can look at the results. Yes. Is it going to be profitable? No. Is it a waste of time? Yes, but at least you know how to use the tool and um that way when you want to backtest a more complicated strategy, you're not figuring it out. Like you already know how to do backtesting on TradingView. Okay. I think the goal should be if we can, to implement a version of of this strategy on there as well, right? Yeah. So, that would be that would be our second attempt at it. Like the first attempt is to actually learn the tool itself. Okay. Okay. Uh, cool. Um, yeah, that makes sense. Hey, Q, you mentioned earlier about um the the Out Breakout strategy. Like how how does that work? Um I think I uh shared it with you. Um So, just looking at here I uh the screenshot. Um What you showed me a lot about the volume rankings uh and comparing them to previous day and things like that, but I I it wasn't clear to me like what what the signal is in that. Uh So, can you look Are you able to see the screenshot from the screener? Yeah, I see it. Yeah. So, if you see the rank is 91, Siren USDT. Yeah. The volume yesterday was uh $800,000. But the volume today is $43 million. Yes. The column column four and column seven. I see the volume percentage. So, the volume percentage change between those two days is about 5,000%. So, it's not volatility percentage change, it's volume percentage change. Yeah. So, just like how you compare how much asset is up or down for the day. Uh I do that for volume. Meaning what was the and this doesn't look at the total volume for the day. So, this runs on, and Naman, this will be useful because uh there is Alpha in here, which is uh So, David, you know my database does not only just have candles, it also has ticks. So, I have I have about 53 billion rows in the database. Right. Yeah. And from from those sticks, I generate a 30-second candle. So, by default, the exchange gives you one minute candle. And they also don't give you the buy and the sell information on that. They only give you the base volume, which is in the asset. So, it does not tell you what is the actual USD volume. So, you cannot compare across assets what is the base volume. No, sorry, what is the USD volume. Right. Yeah. But this with the ticks and with me generating a 30-second candle, I I can then see what was the buy volume, what was the sell volume, and what was the USD total volume. So, the first column is USD buy volume, USD sell volume, USD volume yesterday, but it is And then USD volume, buy volume today, sell volume today, USD total volume today. But this is today is not for the full day because today is up until from 00 to right now. So, I cannot compare the total from all of day yesterday to today. I have to compare um first four hours of yesterday to the first four hours of today. So, this script runs every 30 seconds. Right. Yeah. And then So, this volume that you see on Siren, $810,000. That was not for the entire day. That was until this time yesterday. From the start of yesterday to until this time yesterday. So, you're comparing um the first four hours from yesterday to the first four hours from today. Or first six hours from yesterday to the first six hours from today. Okay. Yeah. And then it is calculating the percentage change between that volume. So, if you see the volume spiked up and this is sorted by volume percentage change in the descending order. So, today the rank is 91, meaning it is still not in the top 50 It is it has climbed up to top 100 in volume today. Because there are 400 assets, 460 on Binance futures. Um and then today, Siren is in the top 100 by trading volume. Uh and if you see because of the volume percentage change, the price has already gone up 15% on it. So, is that like a lag as volume picks up like outside of its norms and then then the price will follow? Yes. That's interesting. Because I I when you mentioned it before, I my sort of a feeling was that there might be a um yeah, it might actually lag the other way, right? Um but that's interesting. So that works as a leading indicator. So, if you see um 1 2 3 4 5 sixth line from the top. Which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 D USDT. Yeah. Uh, the volume percentage change is 1419. Yes. Uh, meaning the volume yesterday was around 1 million. Today is around 23 million. But the price is still negative. Yes. That means the volume has picked up, the price has not yet picked up. So, you expect the price to catch up? Yes. Uh, not not all the time, but there is a signal. So, now if we see today, what is going on with D USDT, you will know uh, that if it is still in the top 10. Uh or what is Uh here we can look at the daily chart. On D USDT. Uh Yeah, you see yesterday there was a huge volume spike on D USDT. Yes, I see. So, even though the price is down today, um like it was up yesterday. It it closed down. But, uh it was up 20% yesterday from low to the high. 25%. So, intraday, there was Yeah, I'm looking at the five minute charts on that now. See the volume coming in and it peaks at the at the at the top. Yes. Which which you would expect. But as long as your signal is generated ahead of that, Yep. Then that's cool. And then I guess I well, I'm I'm assuming it's like a a bit of a scalp trade. Yeah. So, I don't anything ranked greater than 20, I don't I I was telling this to somebody yesterday for bananas. Uh I only put say $1,000 in, and that $1,000 I'm willing to donate to the market because of the tail risk. Like it could go down 90% and I will never see any of it. And I should be okay in doing that. Because that could go that could go 20 so here, when I took the screenshot, Banana was up 51%. So, that is like an outsized return. Say $500 return on a $1,000 trade. Uh I'm definitely not capturing the lows and the highs. But I want to be able to capture the meat of the move. Like if it moves 20%, I want to capture 15 out of it. If it capture if it moves 50%, I want to capture say 30 or 40% out of it. Yeah, okay. I imagine this kind of a strategy, you'd have to backtest a lot of the permutations of it, right? Because that that volume signal has many points where it could be generated, right? Like if you're if you're That's You can't backtest on a single asset because it randomly market makers randomly choose or I don't know what their logic is. So, you have to run it across all 460 to see which one has the volume change. Because otherwise, you're picking with your hindsight bias and that doesn't essentially work. Yeah. But but that's what I mean, right? Like, like you have to backtest using your entire database. You you're testing the whole market universe every day. At the at the time, yes. Yeah. Have you been able to do that? Yes. Okay, that's cool. Yeah, because you could Because you could get in just because the question is like when when do you start buying in? Like if if the volume is here up or 200% up, right? So the rank is only valuable if you can rank across multi and so I could not I could not do this on a one-minute candle because the exchange does not give me the volume in USD. The exchange gives me the volume in the base asset. Yeah. To do this, to compare all the assets and their volume daily, I need to convert that to USD. A standard. And then, once I have converted that into USD, then I can rank them across volume. Like what is the volume for the asset for the day? And how do 460 rank? And then there is also some uh edge in the delta. So, if you see uh actually, all of them. The delta, the CVD is negative. Yeah. Limit bids. Yes. No, not limit bids. It's just people taking profits and the price is still up. Yeah. It has to be right. If the price is up but the CBD's negative, it has to be it has to be the bid walking up the price. Yeah. So so the signal is is in Do you just like look at the top 20 and and just pick the ones to trade or or are you looking for the ones that have the biggest volume percent change? Um so let me share the entire screenshot. Oh, or you could also You could also base it on I don't know if there's signal here like um you could look at which assets are climbing up the rankings the fastest. Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. Now you're getting Now you're getting the hang of it. Yeah. That is that is the edge. When an asset climbs up in ranking, uh some some it doesn't matter if it climbs up in ranking from uh 25 to 22. But it matters a lot if it is moving from say 220 to less than 100. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. But how can you get that unless you have the entire view of the market in real time? Great question. Yeah, I don't think you can. If you're looking at one asset at the Okay, look at this. Omni USDT today. It is up 84%. Yeah. Um the volume percentage change on that is uh 2,000. So, like four-digit volume percentage change. It is in the top top 10. Like Omni USDT is in top 10. Crazy to me. So, I think you'd have to See, this is interesting. I've got an observation on Omni. Anything that I I'm going to share Here, look at this. So now Sorry, David, to interrupt. Um Because you asked because now you understand what the logic is behind the screener. I can share the entire screenshot. Initially, I only shared bits and pieces because one there was no interest and people didn't actually understand what they were looking at. But now you're looking at it and you understand that going up in ranking means the volume is increasing. Yeah, I got that. And so now the first table you see is by volume descending. Simple, rank 1 to 20. Yeah, I see. The second this is just the same data frame printed in three different tables. There's one more table after that, but it is not very important. Uh the second one is volume percentage change, which is sorted by volume percentage change as it says. And then the third table is sorted by price percentage change. So, the highest price is the top top one. Okay. And this run this runs every 30 seconds. So, when I get a new 30-second candle generated in my database based on the ticks. So, look at this. On the top right corner. Uh this screenshot is from 16 4 4:19 p.m. and 03 seconds. But it has data until 4:16 4:19:00. Like, if you see in the screenshot, it says time now today. Yeah. It has data up till that period. So, every it runs every 15 seconds this script and shows me the exact uh outlook of what is happening in the market. Like, I don't need to look at the chart. I can just look at this and tell you what is moving. BTC ETH has two X the volume of BTC. Like ETH volume today is $8 billion versus BTC is $9 billion. How it was yesterday. Yesterday at this time, ETH volume was $19 billion $18.5. So, it is a little lower today. So, this I think I think we might be generating some similar signals because with something like Omni where it's doing absolutely nothing then out of nowhere it just explodes. Um the funding rate signal, um well the funding rate signal fired at basically the same time. So, it fired on that at the top of that first big five-minute candle, that first expansive five-minute candle. Uh I don't know where it would have triggered on a lower time frame is we're not we're not using a lower time frame, but it might have triggered even sooner. I don't know. Um Mhm. But then, if we just work with the five minute for example, and then if you and if you go long on the top of that on the close of that candle and you get a momentum you get a momentum follow through of another 15% right there. And that's Okay. It's a bit of an outlier I can tell you because of how fast it is. But if if your system would have bought that, uh we we would have bought that too. I think we did buy that. Yeah, you see a massive drawdown. No? On the funding rate. Yeah. No. In general, like, so, um and I'll because uh how do I do this? Because this is an anomaly. Uh Not all the volume spikes happen like this. Because this one is unusual. Uh Yeah, it's a very fast one. Yeah, that is a bit of a weird one. And so, I'm looking at a 30-second chart and the reason I'm looking at a 30-second chart is I I'm not trading HFT and so, I'm waiting until a new 30-second candle shows up in my database. And so, if you enter after the first 30-second candle, you you may still be barely able to just break even. Because there was no signal before the 30-second candle. Does that make sense? Makes sense. Uh I guess it depends how fast you're trading this. I mean, that first 30-second candle, it looks like it's closing around about $5. Yes. So, if you're getting in anywhere close to five and you can trade it up to seven, But that's hindsight, David. We don't know if it'll pull back or if you So, so that's that's my question. Like, is it is it possible to backtest the the behavior of these of these things? How how do you like how do you enter and exit these once you get a signal? Uh I enter Right now, my entry is manual. So, I enter with a with a manual entry and a and a tight stop loss. Even yesterday, I took a trade on bananas. Um and rode up like 6, 7%, but that was me manually trailing the stop loss. It's not systematic. I have not been I have not converted this into a There is an edge, but I have not had the time to convert it into a systematic Okay. edge where I leave it and let it go on its own. So so you're in a very similar place to us on the funding rate strategy is is what it seems like to me. Um because our So like so for us, for example, um the idea is once once we get the signal, we we want to we want to be long that market, once our signal fires. Mhm. Um then Wow, wow, wow, wow. In terms of getting out, um the so it will close an open position once the signal um is no longer valid if we still have the open position. But Okay. If if we let it run unattended, which is which is what we've actually done for the last two, three days, um it's really not not working as as good as when it's traded manually. Um So, it sounds like we're in a similar position actually to you then. So, the one strategy to combat that and this is what I learned from this is what I learned from Scott Phillips. Is as you have new data coming in, you adjust your position every minute. You can't just So, when you generate the signal, it can't just be a binary long or short. It has to be adaptive to the new information coming in. So, say it went up in the next 30-second candle it went up 30% or 5%, you you change your stop loss and you move your stop loss. So, it's the system should automatically have a trailing stop loss. Yeah, indeed. Yeah. And and there should be no there should be no take profit. Your exit out of the trade should be based on the stop loss. So, then your stop loss is in profit. Yes, in profit. In profit 2%, in profit 4%, in profit 6%. That has to be adaptive to the new market information that is coming in. So, specifically So, that's that's my question to you, Q. So, so for your strategy, uh correct me if I'm wrong, but but I you know I think you're obviously you're buying these and it's and it's uh momentum it's a momentum long with some kind of a trailing stop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that that's basically how we would manually trade ours as well. Yes. Um the only sort of comment. Ours does have a profitable backtest with with no management uh but it's no but it's not as profitable. Sorry, who? Uh the funding rate, the funding rate trade. I'm I'm sorry, I'm not following. Can you say that again, please? So, I'm I was just I was just doing a comparison of of of your of your your trade, um with the the trade that we do using the funding rate. Um it's a different it's a different signal, but but it's a very similar trade, I think. Um it it has a lot of momentum early on. So, do you know if the exchanges change the funding rate only at the 8-hour mark or do they change it in the middle? Oh, no. They'll change it frequently. So, it updates in real time. Um and then the intervals, the default is every eight hours. But um once funding rates start\ngetting uh extreme, they'll change those intervals um, just without warning. Oh, wow. Okay. This was something that um, Naman had to do quite a lot of work on uh because it was it was mess really messing with our system at first because you know, they would they would publish a funding rate, but the they weren't publishing what the what the interval was. So, if they say the funding rate is two, that's based on eight hours, and then if it if it remains at two, but they change it to four hours, then it's actually four, right? Because it's uh it's 2% every four hours instead of every eight hours. Um, but unless we know that they've updated it, we we can't adjust for it. Yeah. And Naman did find a solution to that in the end, but um, that was one of the complicating factors. And so, so The other thing I'm experiencing right now, if we want to back test uh, any strategy, we should only back test on Bitcoin and see if it is profitable. Reason being that if you even do it on ETH or SOL, you're bringing your hindsight bias in. Meaning you know that SOL and ETH um, have better reflexivity than BTC. Or the second option if you really want to back test a strategy is to back test across all the assets at the same time and have your strategy pick the assets based on the market information, the rank, whatever your logic is. Um, and only then it will be able to pick the right asset across all the assets. Otherwise you're you're always introducing your hindsight bias in into the strategy. Yeah, that makes sense. Makes sense. And so the second option is much complicated, much harder to do, uh, as a single developer. Um, that means you're competing against the hedge fund teams who are doing this for a living and who have much more expertise than you do. And they have much more uh data, much more complex systems, uh, than you do. And so I would personally only back test on BTC. Um, see how the results are. Add fees in to make sure that you're not getting you're not thinking that your strategy is profitable, but when you actually bring it live, it is not. Yeah. Especially on espe especially on these momentum strategies, because momentum strategies you bring in a lot of hindsight bias. Like I I back tested a strategy on Viff, and the sharp ratio was in like six digits. That is impossible. Hm. Because sharp ratio greater than two, people will pay you millions of dollars. But the reason I was back testing it on Viff was because I already knew that it had uh crazy returns on that strategy. Yeah, interesting. Interesting. I think, yeah, with these kinds of breakout strategies, I think you have to be very fast. You have to be very fast. Do you want to automate it, Q? I I would love to. But before I automated, I would love to back test it, uh, to see if uh, even something as basic as the change in rank like we discussed earlier is an entry signal. Because the change in rank is the change in relative volume across all the assets. So an asset going from rank 200 to 100, meaning that people, even though there's no signal on the asset itself, it is a signal in itself that it moved up the rank from 200 to 100. Yeah, that's that's very significant. So I've just got a just to change the subject very quickly. Mm-hmm. Just got a signal on uh Popcat, actually. Okay. Um. Yeah, so the price is touching the 200 200-day moving average, uh and the yearly VWAP. It's not it's not quite overlapping, actually. The yearly VWAP is 2% below. Um. I think that's it's that's a significant signal. At least according to um, according to D-speed. Yeah. Um, let me ask, uh, Naman, are you still there, Naman? Oh, yes, I am. We have to let them up. We'll let you go soon, Naman. Sorry, I know it's very late. Um, Naman, can you remember when we did the back test of um, overlapping levels? What what was the um, what was the uh, the range uh tolerance, um, that they had to be within to be considered overlapping? So, we actually tested the multiple ranges and I think uh the best performing ones was 1.4. No, sorry, 0.4. Okay. So these these are this is two, these are 2% apart. So it doesn't quite qualify then. Yes. Is there's a there's a random a random shitcoin that uh has uh the yearly VWAP and the 200-day moving average. Um uh they're 2% apart from one another and the price is just interacting with the moving average now. That's pretty far. Yeah, it's uh It's basically just Yes, I just said that. It's very far from like usual what we tested. Okay, so probably not not much signal here. It's basically just testing that for support right now since everything across the board is dumping. Yeah. Yeah. Uh David, what what percentage of your trades you said you were short ETH earlier. What percentage of your trades are systematic versus uh discretionary? Oh, it's all it's all discretionary. Um, I mean, aside from what we're working on uh Naman and I, uh everything is discretionary. Okay. Yeah, and and what about for you, Q? Yeah, it's mostly discretionary. I get my signals based on the volume change, momentum change. Uh, but at the end of the day, I And then once I built this screener and the momentum breakout and I I actually because this is very hard to see, uh, you don't see a 19,000 percentage change in volume unless you compare it across all the assets and you compare it across the same time yesterday. And so once I saw this, I was like, okay. Probably there is an edge here that we can look at and exploit. Uh, and if anything, we can immediately, as soon as the price moves up 1 or 2%, we can bring the stop loss to break even. At least that way you're saving your capital and yourself from a drawdown. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. So, so that is something that I want to um, if anything, and if you have time and interest, I can share the code. Uh, this is not in a UI. This is still outputting on the command line. So what we can do is we can we can generate a dashboard that updates automatically and you and I can look at it. Because there's already all this data in the underlying database. We just need to and the queries are ready. Everything is ready. We just need to create the UI for it. If that is something that you are interested in. And so if you click on one of those symbols, it opens up the chart for you. Mammee. Okay. Yeah, I think I'd be very interested. And if it's possible How it if it's possible whenever a symbol crosses a certain threshold or uh increasing rank or or volume change. Yeah. Um, just to observe it at least and then it'd be interesting to just to watch it for a week or two. And then uh Compare notes and maybe formulate some ideas. Yeah, yeah. I think that could be that could be valuable. Yeah. I'm I'm very interested to see if or how often um the signals overlap with the funding rate signal as well. Yeah. Yes. And it might maybe Yeah, so so the other thing is, um, I would say, if Naman wants to work on, is he can import the funding rates into my database. So that way, he's actively using the database. He's writing queries for it. Um, and he can write a script. I can put it on my server, uh, which automatically collects the funding rate. Uh, which he already has on his system. And so that way we can bring in the funding rate on this dashboard. Okay. Yeah, that'd be interesting. Yeah. So, again, there's a lot of a lot of scope for where we can collaborate. Uh for now, we can start with a simple back testing strategy and then and then we can talk more. Okay. Yeah, Q, I think I'm happy with all of that. And then um So lots of yeah, okay. So lots of lots of things to do. Um, we'll we'll fall back on the the tasks, the the immediate tasks that we discussed earlier. Yeah. Um, and then yeah, let's re- should we reconvene in uh, in two or three days? Yeah, that's fine. Maybe one more time before Friday should be good. Okay, fantastic. Um, Yeah. And if you don't mind, uh, don't have to do it now, but Naman, if you can share some code of what your strategy is and how it is. Otherwise, there's I'll just be creating another a completely different strategy from what you have and then obviously the results won't match. So, I want to see if I can recreate your strategy in my back tester. Yeah, I think we can do that. Yeah. Okay, awesome. Um. Okay, I appreciate this call. Thank you. Yeah, likewise, likewise. Let's see what we can do with this. Um, and uh yeah, we'll um stay active on the chat. Um. Yep. And uh we better go now cuz it's uh it's it's past midnight here and I I don't want to know what time it is, uh, when. So um. I'm sorry if it's a little longer than expected. No, all good. All good. All good, Q. Good, good chat. We used to it. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Awesome. Thanks, Q. Speak soon. Yeah, bye-bye. Bye, guys. Oh my goodness, fucking done with that now, finally. Yeah, see, it must be dead.",

A comprehensive review of its performance is scheduled for the end of the current week.\n*   **Automated System Configuration:** The trading system is confirmed to be fully automated from start to end, running on AWS, and is largely hands-off in its operation.\n*   **Profit-Taking Strategy:** It was noted that manual management of 'take profits' is occasionally implemented. This approach is preferred over fixed automated 'take profit' levels as it has proven more effective in optimizing profit realization.\n*   **Optimization for Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE):** Discussion highlighted that the MFE often significantly exceeds the actual realized profit. Manual profit-taking currently helps to bridge this gap, indicating a need for further optimization in the automated system to capture more of the MFE.\n*   **Specific Trade Inquiry (Banana S31 Pump):** An inquiry was made regarding the system's response to a recent Banana S31 pump where funding went negative.\n    *   **Confirmation:** It was confirmed that the automated system indeed executed a trade, as the funding rate closed below the specified 2% threshold, validating the system's rule adherence.\n*   **Current Market Observations:** A 'green dot' indicator was observed on the BTC 5-minute chart. David also mentioned holding a short position on ETH.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n*   The current strategy involving selective manual intervention for 'take profits' will continue due to its observed effectiveness in optimizing realized gains.\n*   A thorough review of the overall funding performance will be conducted by the close of the week.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n*   Aman (or relevant team member) to conduct a detailed review of system logs for the Banana S31 trade to confirm its execution and capture further analytical data.\n*   Initiate efforts to optimize the automated system's algorithms to more effectively capture the 'maximum favorable excursion' (MFE) and enhance overall profit realization.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   Complete the comprehensive review of funding performance by the end of the week.",
